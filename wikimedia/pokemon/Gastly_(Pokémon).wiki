'''Gastly''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴース''' ''Ghos'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Haunter}} starting at [[level]] 25, which evolves into {{p|Gengar}} when [[trade]]d.

==Biology==
[[File:Gastly hands.png|thumb|left|200px|Gastly's "hands"]]
Gastly has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas. However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pokémon surrounded by a purple haze. It has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and is capable of enshrouding an {{wp|Indian elephant}} within two seconds. Because it is mostly gas, Gastly will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds.
	
The [[EP023|anime]] suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, it [[EP095|has shown]] a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It has further [[EP020|been shown]] changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. [[EP023|The anime]] has shown Gastly living in old, dilapidated buildings, but it can also be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}}.

==In the anime==

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Gastly appears in the 3DS version as an enemy in Smash Run mode, as well as a trophy. It is immune to melee attacks.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Ghost/Poison-type Pokémon is made up of several toxic gases&mdash;touching it would be really unpleasant. Instead, try to take it out with projectiles. It's not the fastest enemy in Smash Run, but occasionally it may try to chase down a fighter, so be careful around this gaseous foe.''

'''PAL''': ''In Smash Run, these Ghost- and Poison-type Pokémon tend to move slowly, and then, without warning, chase after you at high speed. You'll get hurt if they so much as come into contact with you, so be on your guard. As ghosts, they're immune to direct attacks. The only way to defeat them is to hit them with projectiles or items.''

===Origin===
Gastly seems to be based on general cartoonish {{wp|ghost}}s and spirits, or maybe a {{wp|will-o'-the-wisp}}. It may also have been based on the Japanese {{wp|yōkai}} {{wp|Onibi#S.C5.8Dgenbi|sōgen bi}}, the decapitated head of a monk whose head is doomed to wander the Earth, consumed by fire. Its {{t|Poison}} type is most likely a reference to poisonous or polluted gases.

====Name origin====
Gastly may be a combination of ''{{wp|gas}}'' and ''ghastly'' (like a ghost; dreadfully frightening).

Ghos is a shortened form of ''{{wp|ghost}}'' and may also incorporate ''gas'' into its name.
