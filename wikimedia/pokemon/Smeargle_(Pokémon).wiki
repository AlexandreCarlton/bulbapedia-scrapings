'''Smeargle''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ドーブル''' ''Doble'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Smeargle is best known for its ability to use the move {{m|Sketch}}, which permanently copies the last move used by the opponent. Due to this, it can legitimately have any [[move]] in the Pokémon games except for {{m|Chatter}}, {{m|Struggle}}, and [[Shadow move]]s. As a result of this, it can pass on any [[Egg Move]] to Pokémon in the {{egg3|Field}}.

==Biology==
Smeargle is a bipedal, beagle-like Pokémon with white and brown fur. It has a long tail with an end resembling a paintbrush. This paintbrush oozes with paint, and the color of the paint may vary for each Smeargle, as well as change in hue coressponding to its emotions. Sprites from the games depict green, brown, and red, while [[EP197|the anime]] also shows yellow and blue. Smeargle has a footprint on its back that is the same color as the tip of the tail. Smeargle also has a round structure on its head with a point that resembles a {{wp|beret}}. It has floppy, brown ears and a brown collar on its neck. The rings encircling Smeargle's eyes are also brown, as are Smeargle's eyelids. Its arms have two brown bands, and its legs have only one. Each of its limbs have three digits. 

Smeargle will use the paint to mark its territory. It can also use its [[signature move]], {{m|Sketch}}, to copy moves from other Pokémon. Smeargle is often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}}.

==Trivia==
* Due to its [[signature move]] {{m|Sketch}}, Smeargle can legitimately know almost any move, giving it a number of distinctions:
** Smeargle can pass down any [[Egg Move]] combination to any Pokémon in the {{egg3|Field}}. This was important in Generations II to V, when only the father could pass down Egg Moves.
** {{m|Hidden Power}}-evaluating NPCs cannot identify the type of Smeargle's Hidden Power even if Smeargle possesses the move, due to being unable to use the TM for it.
** Smeargle is able to Sketch {{m|Hyperspace Fury}}, but the move will always fail when used by Pokémon other than {{p|Hoopa}} [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Hoopa|Unbound]].
** Smeargle is able to Sketch {{m|Dark Void}}, but starting in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon]], the move will always fail when used by Pokémon other than {{p|Darkrai}}.
* Smeargle is the only Pokémon capable of learning the same move more than four times—some Pokémon have the same move available at level 1 as well as by leveling up, while Smeargle has the same move available ten times as it levels up.
* In the anime, Smeargle have been seen with different colored-tipped tails.
** This is also the case in [[Pokémon Stadium 2]], where they also have differently-colored backs.
* In the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]] mission "Smeargle's Desperate Plea", even though the Smeargle refuses to have a paw painted onto its back, the paw print is nonetheless present on its sprite.
* In [[Pokémon Colosseum]] and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]], Smeargle's tail has a brown tip in its normal coloration (as it was in [[Generation II]]) instead of a green one, despite these games being part of [[Generation III]]. This is due to the games re-using models from [[Pokémon Stadium 2]] for first and second-generation Pokémon.

===Origin===
Smeargle appears to be based on a {{wp|beagle}} and a {{wp|painter}}.

====Name origin====
Smeargle may be a combination of ''smear'' and ''beagle''.

Doble may be a combination of ''dog'' and ''doodle'' or ''dabble'' (to splatter liquid, which could be a reference to paint being splattered). ''Doble'' also means ''double'' in Spanish, perhaps referencing Smeargle's ability to copy opponent's techniques.
