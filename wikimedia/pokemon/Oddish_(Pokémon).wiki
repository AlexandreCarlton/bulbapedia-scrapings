'''Oddish''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ナゾノクサ''' ''Nazonokusa'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Gloom}} starting at [[level]] 21, which evolves into {{p|Vileplume}} when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]] or into {{p|Bellossom}} when exposed to a [[Sun Stone]].

==Biology==
Oddish resembles a blue plant bulb with a round body, beady red eyes, and oval, foot-like roots. Five large, green leaves sprout from its head. As demonstrated in [[EP137|the anime]], these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects.

Known by the scientific name ''Oddium Wanderus'', Oddish lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}. A nocturnal Pokémon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators. If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly. It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow. Oddish will wander up to 1000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself. The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be. It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted. In the past, {{m|Petal Dance}} was its [[signature move]].

==Trivia==
* In [[Generation II]], [[Bill's grandfather]] asks the player to bring him a "round, green" Pokémon with leaves growing on its head, referring to Oddish. However, in those games and subsequent generations, Oddish's body (unless it is {{Shiny}}) is blue. The mistake might have been a translation error caused by the ambiguity of the Japanese word ''aoi'', which can mean both blue and green. This is fixed in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}.
* Oddish has a scientific name: ''Oddium Wanderus'', given in its {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|FireRed}} and {{pkmn|X and Y|Y}} Pokédex entries. The only other Pokémon with a known scientific name is {{p|Kabutops}}, with ''Kabutops Maximis''.
** Oddish's alias name is アルキメンデス ''Arukimendesu'', as stated in the Japanese versions of FireRed as well as its {{2v2|Red|Green}} Pokédex entries. This can either be seen as a corruption of ''{{wp|Archimedes}}'', the Greek mathematician, or as a direct reference to a popular Japanese instant noodles brand ''{{jwp|アルキメンデス|Archimendes}}'' that literally means ''instant noodles on the go''. The latter may reference Oddish's appearance when walking.
* Oddish can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Bellsprout}}. Both are {{2t|Grass|Poison}}-type {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}}, {{cat|Pokémon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary line|part of a three-stage evolutionary line}}, can evolve starting at level 21, and whose second evolutionary event utilizes a [[Leaf Stone]]. Oddish is exclusive to {{game3|Red and Blue|Pokémon Red|s}} and {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|FireRed|s}}, while Bellsprout is exclusive to Blue and LeafGreen, with both Pokémon found in the same locations in their respective versions. Additionally, both can be found at [[White Forest]] in {{game3|Black and White|White|s}}, and both Pokémon have had their {{pkmn|Egg}} designs revealed.
* In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Oddish is programmed to be able to learn {{m|Charm}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, but no other Pokémon in the {{egg2|Grass}} can legitimately learn it to pass down as an [[Egg Move]] in those games. In [[Generation III]] and {{Gen|IV}}, Oddish can inherit the move from {{p|Shroomish}} by chain breeding. In Generation V on, Oddish can inherit the move directly from {{p|Cottonee}}.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Oddish}}
Oddish is most likely based on a {{wp|mandrake (plant)|mandrake}}.

====Name origin====
Oddish is a combination of ''odd'' and ''{{wp|radish}}'' (a vegetable) and a pun on ''oddish'', meaning "somewhat odd."

Nazonokusa literally means "enigmatic grass" (謎の草 ''nazo no kusa'').
