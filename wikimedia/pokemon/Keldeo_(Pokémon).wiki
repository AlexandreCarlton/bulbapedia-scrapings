'''Keldeo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ケルディオ''' ''Keldeo'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Fighting}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon, it has a [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Keldeo|second form]], which is activated by triggering an event in the [[Pledge Grove]], where {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Virizion}}, and {{p|Terrakion}} teach it {{m|Secret Sword}}, and it changes its form permanently as long as it knows Secret Sword. Its original form, '''Ordinary Form''', will then become '''Resolute Form'''.

Keldeo was {{n|Keldeo to be revealed in upcoming CoroCoro|leaked}} on a photo of a page from [[CoroCoro]] magazine on February 13, 2012, and it was officially revealed on [http://www.pokemon.co.jp/info/2012/02/120215_g01.html?a001=news February 15, 2012]. Its Resolute Form was officially revealed June 13, 2012.

Along with {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Virizion}}, Keldeo is a member of the [[Swords of Justice]].

==Biology==
Keldeo is a quadruped, colt-like Pokémon with a cream-colored body. It has a short, rounded snout with large nostrils, and blue eyes. It has a large, feathery red mane, long, dark blue, ridged eyebrow-like protrusions, and a single cream-colored horn that curves slightly. The back of its head, as well as its neck, is covered with fluffy, light blue fur. Keldeo has blue hooves, which are capable of ejecting water. Its tail is light blue with white spots and resembles an elaborate feather in a cap.

Upon learning {{m|Secret Sword}}, Keldeo transforms into its Resolute Form. The dark blue protrusions become shorter and lighter in color, resembling ears. Its horn becomes dark blue, and grows larger and ridged. On the side of its head are three feathers colored aqua blue, green and orange.

Keldeo tends to cross the world, and often appears at beautiful watersides. It can walk across water by ejecting water from its hooves. It is thought that when Keldeo becomes resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter.

==History==
Long ago, a fire started in the [[Moor of Icirrus]] because of a war among people. In this fire, Keldeo was separated from its parents, but together, {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Virizion}} took care of Keldeo. They acted as its parents, and they taught it knowledge and moves for survival. Keldeo eventually grew and even surpassed the three Pokémon. One day, Keldeo took off from the forest with no one knowing why.

When the four meet again, they teach Keldeo the move {{m|Secret Sword}}.

The Sword of Justice]]'', being one of its stars alongside [[Swords of Justice (M15)|Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion]], and {{mov|Kyurem|Kyurem|15}}. In the film, it was training in order to learn how to use {{m|Sacred Sword}} so it could become one of the [[Swords of Justice]]. However, it arrogantly picked a fight with Kyurem before it could learn the move. During the course of the battle, Keldeo became terrified and eventually fled, but it was pursued relentlessly by Kyurem, who was determined to finish their battle. Along with the other Legendary Pokémon present in the movie, Keldeo can [[Talking Pokémon|speak through telepathy]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Keldeo event art.png|thumb|220px|Keldeo in its Ordinary Form]]
* As the fourth member of the [[Swords of Justice]], it shares several traits with them, but is somewhat different in a number of ways:
** Unlike the others, Keldeo is unable to learn {{m|Quick Attack}}. Instead, it is capable of learning {{m|Aqua Jet}}, a [[move variations|variation]] of Quick Attack.
** The moves that Keldeo learns by level have higher base powers than the moves learned by the other Swords of Justice.
** Keldeo learns {{m|Sacred Sword}} later than the others.
** Its legs seem to be stylized after animal legs and hooves, unlike the others, which seem to have boots.
** Keldeo isn't listed near the other three in [[National Pokédex]] order.
** Keldeo's name doesn't end with -ion.
* Keldeo, along with {{p|Meloetta}}, are the only [[Mythical Pokémon]] to learn their [[signature move]]s from an external source.
* Keldeo has the lowest base stat total of all Mythical Pokémon, excluding {{p|Phione}}, whose Mythical status is disputed.
* Its trait of running across water mirrors {{p|Suicune}}, another quadrupedal {{type|Water}} Pokémon.
* Due to Keldeo not being legitimately available in {{g|Black and White}} outside of events, the Legendary Pokémon battle theme and the Swords of Justice intro can only play when Keldeo is battled in-game via [[cheating]].
* Keldeo is the lightest and smallest of the Swords of Justice.

===Origin===
Keldeo is most likely based on the legend of the {{wp|kelpie}}, a supernatural water horse that sometimes appeared as a lost pony. Keldeo is also likely based on the {{wp|Qilin|kirin}} also referred to as the "Chinese {{wp|unicorn}}" which are often depicted with a single backwards curving horn and possess the ability to walk on water. Keldeo also draws inspiration from the character of {{wp|d'Artagnan}} from the novel ''{{wp|The Three Musketeers}}''. Like d'Artagnan, it is the latest and youngest addition to the group. Keldeo's tail also resembles d'Artagnan's trademark feathered cap.

====Name origin====
Keldeo may be derived from ''kelda'' ({{wp|Old Norse}} for ''spring/fountain'') or may be a combination of ''{{wp|kelpie}}'', (a water horse from Celtic folklore) and ''{{wp|rodeo}}'' (a sport involving skills with horses, cows, and other livestock).
Furthermore, "deo" is Latin for "god".
