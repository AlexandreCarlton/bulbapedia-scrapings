'''Tornadus''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''トルネロス''' ''Tornelos'') is a {{type|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon, it has a [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Forces of Nature|second Forme]] activated by using the [[Reveal Glass]]. Its original Forme, '''Incarnate Forme''', will then become '''Therian Forme'''.

Its Therian Forme was officially revealed May 12, 2012.

Along with {{p|Thundurus}} and {{p|Landorus}}, it is a part of the [[Forces of Nature]].

==Biology==
In Incarnate Forme, Tornadus is a green, muscular humanoid Pokémon, which resembles a genie. It is a male-only species with no female counterpart. On its forehead are two, purple, long and sharp horns. Tornadus has white, wavy and billowy styled hair, a spiky white mustache and two pointed green ears on either side of its head. Its eyes are yellow with beady white irises and no visible pupils. The front of Tornadus's body is covered in various, irregularly shaped purple spots. Its broad, purple chest consists of two joined, partially diamond shaped pectorals and its shoulders, elbows and navel are adorned with raindrop like designs. It has two spotted muscular arms, with five fingers on each hand. Its lower body consists of a trailing cloud, with a purple long, curling tail, tipped with a whirl. Spanning the length of its tail, Tornadus has several whorled structures. They are a light Khaki color, and follow the same direction as the tip of its tail.

In Therian Forme, Tornadus is a large, green, bipedal, long-necked, bird-like Pokémon. It now lacks any visible ears, and the horns on its forehead have become thinner and crest-like. Tornadus's hair is also now crest-like, and the direction of its hair whirl is reversed. The style of its hair is now more relaxed as well, proudly flowing down its long neck. Tornadus's mustache now takes on a more beak-like appearance, puffing out on the edges like coarse plumage against its cheeks. Its eyes remain yellow, but with larger irises which still lack visible pupils. Its chest is now fuller, but remains largely unchanged, while its navel is now bejeweled with a red gem. Tornadus's arms have now become large spanning, feathered wings; each possessing thumbs and five large, purple tipped primary feathers. It has two strong legs and sharp talons, each with three sharp purple claws and one dewclaw. Tornadus's tail remains largely unchanged, although it appears slightly longer and less curved than before. On its lower back, it has a large trailing cloud-like puff.

Tornadus can travel at speeds of 200 miles per hour (320 kilometers per hour). It can also whip up storms with its tail, and is able to blow away houses.

===Major appearances===
===={{DL|Forces of Nature (anime)|Tornadus|Tornadus (anime)}}====
Tornadus made his main series debut in ''[[BW059|Stopping the Rage of Legends! Part 1]]''. He appeared in [[Milos Island]]'s legend and then attacked unexpectedly when {{Ash}}, {{ashfr}} and [[Lewis]] tried to summon {{p|Landorus}}. Once {{p|Thundurus}} appeared, the two engaged in a fierce battle. He then appeared in ''[[BW060|Stopping the Rage of Legends! Part 2]]'', where he ultimately was calmed by Landorus.

Tornadus appeared in both of his Formes in ''[[BW097|Unova's Survival Crisis!]]'', where he was summoned to the [[Abyssal Ruins]] by {{an|Giovanni}} and sent on a rampage alongside Thundurus and Landorus. Eventually, he was freed by {{an|Meloetta}} and departed.

====Other====
A Therian Forme Tornadus appeared in the Hoopa's Surprise Ring Adventures short ''{{DL|Hoopa's Surprise Ring Adventures|Flying in the Air}}''.

===Minor appearances===

===In the Be the Best! Pokémon B+W manga===

==Trivia==
* Tornadus is the [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|only]] pure {{type|Flying}} Pokémon. However, other Pokémon are able to temporarily become pure Flying types through their Abilities or moves, such as {{p|Kecleon}}, {{p|Arceus}} and {{p|Silvally}}.
** This also makes it the only single-type Pokémon with a [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|unique type combination]].
<!--** Also because of this, it is the only Pokémon that can have the Flying-type backdrop after defeating the [[Pokémon League]] in {{2v2|Black|White}}, as the backdrop will always reflect the Pokémon's primary type. (What about Sky-Plate Arceus?)-->
* Tornadus is the only member of its trio whose Therian Forme is not immune to {{type|Electric}} attacks in normal battle conditions.
** It is also the only one that can have a weakness to Electric-type attacks in standard battle conditions.
* Tornadus and {{p|Thundurus}} have identical base stat distributions in their Incarnate Formes.
* Tornadus is the only single-type [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].
* When Tornadus appears on {{rt|7|Unova}} in {{game|Black and White|s|Pokémon Black}}, {{p|Thundurus}}'s cry is heard.
* In an interview with Nintendo Dream, [[Ken Sugimori]] revealed that Tornadus was originally intended to be red.
* Prior to Generation VI, Tornadus's Therian Forme had the same [[List of Pokémon by body style|body style]] as its Incarnate Forme.

===Origin===
In Incarnate Forme, Tornadus may be based on {{wp|Fūjin}}, the {{wp|kami}} of wind. It may also have drawn inspiration from {{wp|genies}}.

In Therian Forme, Tornadus seems to be based on a bird of prey, most likely an eagle, vulture or other large avian species. It may also draw inspiration from the {{wp|Vermilion Bird}} of the Chinese Four Symbols constellation, or from {{wp|Huitzilopochtli}}, a god from the Aztec mythology that resembles a hummingbird.

====Name origin====
Tornadus and Tornelos may be derived from ''{{wp|tornado}}'' and ''{{wp|Aeolus}}'', ruler of the winds in Greek mythology.
