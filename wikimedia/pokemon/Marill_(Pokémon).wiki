'''Marill''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マリル''' ''Maril'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a pure {{type|Water}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Azurill}} when [[level]]ed up with high [[friendship]] and evolves into {{p|Azumarill}} starting at [[level]] 18.

==Biology==
Marill is a small, blue bipedal Pokémon. It has a nearly spherical shape with a white belly, and has round ears with red insides. These sensitive ears can detect distant sounds. Its arms and feet are short and possess no visible digits. There is a blue, bubble-like ball at the tip of its zigzagging black tail. The tail is flexible and configured to stretch, and the ball is full of oil. The oil is lighter than water, and keeps Marill afloat in the water. [[AG032|In the anime]], Marill was shown to be able to bounce on its tail.

Marill is able to swim in strong water currents without being slowed down by the water's resistance, due to its water-repellent fur. Marill feeds on aquatic plants in addition to fishing for food. When it dives, its tail can be seen bobbing on the water's surface. It will anchor its tail around a tree when fishing at the edge of a fast moving stream. It lives on the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|water's edge}}.

''This Aqua Mouse Pokémon evolves into Azumarill. The round ball on the end of its tail acts like a flotation device, so it can float safely on the roughest of water conditions. It resides on [[Mt. Mortar]] in seclusion; few of the creatures are ever seen. Marill's cuteness has earned it a large and loyal fan base.''

==Trivia==
[[File:Alpha mariru.png|thumb|150px|Early concept art for Marill]]
* Marill's early design had a pink body instead of blue, noticeably smaller ears, and lacked the erratic tail pattern.
* For months prior to the release of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Marill was often incorrectly referred to as "Pikablu", likely because of its slight resemblance to {{p|Pikachu}}.
** It is even referred to as "Pikablu" on the [[Pokémon the First Movie Trading Cards|Topps trading cards for the first movie]].
* Because {{p|Azurill}}'s gender ratio does not match that of its evolved forms and its evolution is not dependent on gender, being female 75% of the time while Marill and Azumarill are female only 50% of the time, female Azurill have a one in three chance of [[Evolution|evolving]] into a male Marill prior to [[Generation VI]]. Whether or not this will happen is determined by its [[personality value]]. Azurill is the only Pokémon to do this.
* Marill's name was originally spelled '''Marril''', as shown in some merchandise for [[M01|the first movie]].
* Marill is the only Pokémon that evolves from a [[Baby Pokémon]] and has a [[level]] requirement for evolving further.

===Origin===
Marill may be based upon a combination of a {{wp|mouse}} and a {{wp|beach ball}} or possibly a {{wp|personal flotation device}} or {{wp|lifebuoy}}. Its body and ears also resemble a {{wp|water molecule}}.

It may be possibly based on the {{wp|rakali}} (''Hydromys chrysogaster''), who are said to live in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries, and are commonly known as {{wp|water rat}}s.

====Name origin====
Marill and Maril may be a combination of 丸い ''marui'' (''round'' or ''circular'') or 鞠 ''mari'' (ball), 瑠璃 ''ruri'' ({{wp|lapis lazuli}}), and possibly ''rill'' (a small river or brook). It may also be derived from マリンブルー ''marine blue'', an old name for {{wp|navy blue}}.
