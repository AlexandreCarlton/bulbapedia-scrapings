'''Latios''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラティオス''' ''Latios'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Latios''' using the [[Latiosite]].

==Biology==
{{incomplete|2=description of Mega Latios}}
Latios is a bird-like, dragon Pokémon with an aerodynamic body. The lower half of its body is blue with jet-plane wings and fin-like feet. It has a red triangular marking on its chest. By tucking its wings and forelimbs, it can fly faster than a jet. It has white and blue arms that can be tucked into its body. The upper-half of its body is white. It has triangular ears and a blue face with a white oval in the middle. Latios is a male only species; {{p|Latias}} is the female counterpart.

[[M05|In the fifth movie]], Latios had the ability "Sight Sharing" (Japanese: '''ゆめうつし''' ''Dream Analysis'') which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. [[Oakley]] also mentioned that it can shape-shift. It prefers compassionate Trainers, to whom it opens its heart. It uses telepathy to detect locations and the emotions of others, and can understand human speech. It lives by the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|water's edge}}. Latios is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning {{m|Luster Purge}}.

They travel in herds, but even so, are rarely seen. They're a combination of Dragon- and Psychic-types."''

==Trivia==
* Latios shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Latias}}. They are both known as the Eon Pokémon.

===Origin===
Latios appears to be a cross between a {{wp|Jet aircraft|jet plane}} and a {{wp|dragon}}. It and {{p|Latias}} may also draw inspiration from the philosophy of {{wp|yin and yang}}. They may also be based upon the {{wp|Aeon#In Gnosticism|aeons in Gnosticism}}, being that certain aeons are immaterial beings of concepts existing in pairs of males and females emanated from God and one another; also, their {{pkmn|category}} is "Eon." Latias and Latios are also based on birds, and due to Latias's {{DL|List of unused Pokémon and character designs|Blaziken / Latias|shared origin}} with {{p|Blaziken}}, they could be based on {{wp|junglefowl}}.

====Name origin====
Latios may derive from ''latere'' ({{wp|Latin}} for "to lie hidden"). ''Os'' as a suffix may have been added to make it sound more masculine, opposite the more feminine-sounding ''as'' in {{p|Latias}}.
