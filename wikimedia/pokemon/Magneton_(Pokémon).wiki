'''Magneton''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レアコイル''' ''Rarecoil'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation II]], it was a pure {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Magnemite}} starting at [[level]] 30 and evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]].

==Biology==
[[File:Clemont Magneton three Magnemite.png|thumb|200px|left|Magneton splitting into three Magnemite]]
Magneton is the result of three Magnemite being linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when no other Magnemite are in the vicinity. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked via body on the bottom, forming a triangle. However, in some cases, commonly seen in 3D Pokémon games, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remaining in a triangular formation at rest, and being able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. The magnetic forces that holds the three Magnemite together is powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature 3.6&nbsp;°F (2&nbsp;°C) within a 3,300 foot (1,000&nbsp;m) radius. It can also be disruptive to electronic devices.

Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as electrically powerful, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. [[EP195|As seen in the anime]], food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|rough terrain}}, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, they also gather in high areas prone to lightning strikes. It has been shown [[PS011|in the manga]] that it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been [[Media:Neo Premium File 2.jpg|discovered]] at the [[Ruins of Alph]], and one was [[PG18|shown]] in a flashback to the great war of [[Kalos]], indicating it has existed for at least 3000 years.

However, later in ''[[PS011|Buzz Off, Electabuzz!]]'', some of them tortured Red with {{m|Thunderbolt}}. Lt. Surge uses two on his shoulder pads in ''[[PS029|Go for the Golbat]]'' where they produced sonic booms that act as a defensive barrier. Lt. Surge has a squad of Magneton, capable of using electromagnetism to create a tetrahedral aura. This aura is able to ferry people as well as attack and trap anything within, as seen in Volumes [[Pokémon Adventures volume 3|3]], [[Pokémon Adventures volume 7|7]], [[Pokémon Adventures volume 10|10]], and [[Pokémon Adventures volume 12|12]].

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Magneton is originally known as "Recoil."
* Magneton, along with its pre-evolution {{p|Magnemite}}, were pure Electric-type Pokémon in Generation I, but became dual-type {{2t|Electric|Steel}} in Generation II. This makes them the first Pokémon to ever change type, and the only ones to do so until Generation V when {{p|Rotom}}'s formes were given an additional type.
* Although it is said that Magneton is made up of three Magnemite, there is contradictory evidence seen in various forms of media.
** In the only anime episode to date showing a Magnemite evolution, ''[[EP101|Get Along, Little Pokémon]]'', when {{OBP|Ethan|EP101}}'s Magnemite #6 evolves into Magneton, it "creates" two Magnemite during evolution, instead of combining with two real Magnemite. Similarly, in the main series games, when Magnemite reaches level 30, it evolves without the aid of two additional Magnemite. This is unlike {{p|Mantyke}} which requires a {{p|Remoraid}} to evolve.
** In {{g|Snap}}, a Magneton is clearly shown to be created by three Magnemite. Also, when two Magnemite get stuck together halfway through evolution in the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|original Mystery Dungeon games]], they mention how three Magnemite must come together to evolve.
** After evolution, Magneton becomes exactly ten times heavier than Magnemite. Logically, it would be three times heavier if it were actually made of three Magnemite. Magnemite weighs 13.2&nbsp;lbs. (6.0&nbsp;kg) whereas Magneton weighs 132.3&nbsp;lbs. (60.0&nbsp;kg).
* Magneton, along with {{p|Magnemite}}, has [[List of Pokémon that appear in every regional Pokédex|appeared in every regional Pokédex]]. This is due to the Sinnoh Pokédex's expansion in Platinum and the Unova Pokédex's expansion in Black 2 and White 2.
* Magneton and its pre-evolution {{p|Magnemite}} are two of few Pokémon that had their [[cry]] changed slightly in [[Generation III]]. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and [[Game Boy Advance|newer game system]].
* Magneton has been used by more rival characters than any other Pokémon, being used by three: {{ga|Blue}}, {{ga|Silver}}, and [[Wally]].
* Despite most depictions of Magneton showing they are able to float through the air, Magneton does not have the Ability {{a|Levitate}}, so it is still affected by {{type|Ground}} moves. However, starting in [[Generation IV]], Magneton can learn {{m|Magnet Rise}}, which simulates Levitate for five turns.

===Origin===
Magneton is a cluster of three {{p|Magnemite}} which in turn seems to be based on the objectification of {{wp|electromagnetism}}, one of the four {{wp|fundamental interactions}} of nature. They are likely linked through strong electromagnetic force.

====Name origin====
Magneton may be a reference to ''magneton'', a unit of magnetic movement, or a {{wp|magnetron}} forms the core of a {{wp|microwave oven}}.

Rarecoil may be a reference to {{wp|rare-earth magnet}}s.
