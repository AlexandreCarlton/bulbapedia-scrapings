'''Suicune''' (Japanese: '''スイクン''' ''Suicune'') is a {{type|Water}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Entei}}, it is one of the [[Legendary beasts]] resurrected by {{p|Ho-Oh}} after the burning of the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]. Of the three Legendary beasts, Suicune is said to represent the rains that quenched the flames of the burning Brass Tower.

Suicune is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Crystal}}, appearing on the boxart.

Suicune is pursued in the {{pkmn|anime}}, [[Pokémon Adventures|manga]], {{game|Crystal}}, and {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} by [[Eusine]].

==Biology==
Suicune is a slim, quadruped, blue, mammalian Pokémon with white, diamond-shaped markings. Its face and underside are white as well. Suicune has a thick, purple mane that resembles the {{wp|aurora borealis}} and two white, streamer-like tails that wave forward. It has a long, white snout. Suicune has a large, hexagonal, cerulean blue crest on its forehead that resembles the antlers of a {{wp|Qilin}} with two prongs on either side of the base. It has red eyes, a small tuft of fur under its chin, and small paws with white paw pads.

Suicune has the power to walk across water and purify dirty water with one touch. It travels across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} in search of water to purify. Northern winds always seem to blow stronger in its presence. In {{game|Crystal}}, Suicune is said to be the closest of the [[Legendary beasts]] to {{p|Ho-Oh}}. It is also said to have a link to the {{p|Unown}}. [[DP028|In the anime]], Suicune is shown to be heroic, serious, and calm during dangerous situations.

==In the manga==
[[File:Misty Suicune Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Suicune in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Suicune (M04)}} ''and [[Legendary beasts (M13)|Suicune (M13)]]''
Two different Suicune appeared in the {{ma|Celebi: a Timeless Encounter|manga}} {{ma|Zoroark: Master of Illusions|adaptations}} of the [[M04|fourth]] and [[M13|thirteenth]] [[Pokémon movie]]s.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Legendary beasts (Adventures)#Suicune|Suicune (Adventures)}}
Suicune appeared as a beam of light in ''[[PS117|Slugging It Out With Slugma]]''. It wasn't officially seen until ''[[PS122|Querulous Qwilfish]]'' where it had cured the baby Qwilfish {{adv|Crystal}} had rescued and cleansed the sea water. It appeared in ''[[PS138|Really Raikou & Entirely Entei I]]'', joining Raikou and Entei against Falkner and afterwards discussed with them about Ho-oh. It was revealed in a flashback in ''[[PS141|Hello, Lickitung]]'', where it was awakened by {{adv|Yellow}} along with its two counterparts, and the three raced around [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]] looking for {{pkmn|Trainer}}s to help them defeat the [[Masked Man]] to free {{p|Ho-Oh}}. Suicune, in particular, personally challenges many of the [[Gym Leader]]s in the two [[region]]s. During its travels, it encounters both [[Eusine]] and {{adv|Crystal}}, both of which become obsessed with capturing it. Eusine acquires the [[Clear Bell|Crystal Bell]] from the Rocket trio he defeats, but he and Crystal are still unable to capture Suicune. Crystal has her confidence shattered by this (and by the guilt of interrupting Suicune's attempt to contact its old master) and has to retreat back to her old training grounds to regain her confidence, which she does by reacquiring her catching skills capturing a wild {{p|Larvitar}}. Suicune later chooses [[Misty]] as its partner and fights alongside her, but then pairs up with Crystal anyways after Misty becomes injured (much to the dismay of Eusine).

A Ditto transformed into a Suicune to distract Crystal and Eusine in ''[[PS127|Miltank Melee]]'', while [[Team Rocket Elite Trio|Ken, Al and Harry]] surrounded the real one. Ditto's stretchiness was able to grab both of them, but Crystal managed to escaped with her [[Monlee]] and defeated the Ditto.

An ice sculpture of a Suicune appeared in [[Mahogany Town#Mahogany Gym|Mahogany Gym]] in ''[[PS143|Irked Igglybuff and Curmudgeonly Cleffa]]'', where it started to move and battled against [[Whitney]] and [[Pryce]]. It was later destroyed in ''[[PS144|Savvy Swinub]]'', were it was revealed to Whitney and the Radio Crew that Pryce uses it for battle practice.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Suicune (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:Pokkén Suicune.png|220px|thumb|Suicune in Pokkén Tournament]]
===[[Pokkén Tournament]]===
Suicune is a Standard-type playable character in Pokkén. Moves it can use include {{m|Aurora Beam}}, {{m|Hydro Pump}}, {{m|Mirror Coat}}, and {{m|Blizzard}}. In Burst Form, it can use the Burst Attack True {{m|Sheer Cold}}.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]/[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Suicune unleashes a blast of {{m|Blizzard}} that causes high levels of damage. Suicune returns in Brawl but with a different [[move|attack]], {{m|Aurora Beam}}.

Suicune reappears in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]], functioning the same as in Brawl. In these games, it can also be summoned from a [[Master Ball]].

====Melee trophy information====
''This mystical aurora Pokémon constantly journeys in search of places with pure flowing water. Suicune wields the power to instantly purify any contaminated water it finds. Some say Suicune is the north wind reborn. Its strange and dramatic story is told over the course of the Crystal version of the Pokémon game.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"An Aurora Pokémon. It has the power to instantly purify even the filthiest water. Suicune is said to be the reincarnation of the northern wind, so when it shows up, so does that wind. Suicune uses the move Aurora Beam--aurora light focused into a powerful beam. Along with inflicting damage, this attack also lowers the target's attack power."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
'''NA''': ''A Legendary Pokémon that emerged from the ashes of the Burned Tower, Suicune is a Water-type Pokémon easily identified by its long, purple mane. In battle, it'll head toward a nearby fighter and fire an Aurora Beam all the way to the edge of the screen. If you get hit, you'll be frozen solid! ''

'''PAL''': ''Suicune is one of the Legendary Pokémon from the Burned Tower in Ecruteak City. Its mane is said to resemble an aurora floating over it. If summoned in battle, it'll make its way straight for a nearby fighter and unleash its Aurora Beam. The target, frozen in place, is unable to resist as it's blown off the stage. ''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Crystal}}: It is possible to see Suicune multiple times on the overworld before the actual battle in [[Bell Tower]]. In these occasions, it will always hop away on being spotted.
* {{g|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}: As in Crystal, Suicune will roam Johto and Kanto before finally battling the player. After being first seen in the [[Burned Tower]], it runs to [[Cianwood City]], [[Mt. Mortar]], [[Vermilion Harbor]], and {{rt|14|Kanto}} before giving itself up at the end of {{rt|25|Kanto}} after defeating [[Misty]]. If it is not caught, Suicune can be found in the Burned Tower after defeating the [[Elite Four]] again.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Suicune first appears alongside {{p|Raikou}} up on [[Revelation Mountain]] where they confronted {{mdc|Krookodile|smd}} believing he turned {{p|Entei}} to stone but discovered {{p|Nuzleaf}} was responsible and was turned to stone. Suicune later helped the {{player}} and [[Partner Pokémon|partner]] escape from the [[Voidlands]].

==Trivia==
* Suicune, along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Entei}}, was designed by [[Muneo Saitō]].<ref>http://kai-you.net/article/5034</ref>
* Suicune's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are the same: 245.
* Suicune is the only game mascot part of a Legendary trio whose fellow members are not game mascots.

===Origin===
Suicune is thought to be based on numerous creatures and mythological deities, mainly the {{wp|Qilin}} or "Kirin", an Eastern legend that has traits of {{wp|chinese dragons}}, {{wp|unicorns}}, {{wp|deer}}, {{wp|big cats}}, and other beasts. The Qilin was said to be able to walk on water and is known to be a powerful and peaceful creature. The crest on Suicune's head roughly matches the description of the beast's antlers. The spots of Suicune are also significant, seeming to combine the spots of a {{wp|leopard}}, taking homage from {{wp|Fūjin}}, the Shinto god of The North Wind, who wears leopard skin. Leopards themselves are found in Asia and are featured in myths that show it is a widely respected sacred animal like the Qilin. The way it runs and roars in the anime may also relate to the leopard. Being a Pokémon that represents the wind and rain, Suicune may also be based on some of the world's numerous myths of wind deities. Suicune's mane is meant to resemble a northern {{wp|Aurora (astronomy)|aurora}}.

====Name origin====
Suicune may be a combination of 水 ''sui'' (water) and 君 ''kun'' (monarch). The [[Pokémon Crystal Version|game title]] it is the mascot of suggests that it may derive from 水晶 ''suishō'' (crystal).
