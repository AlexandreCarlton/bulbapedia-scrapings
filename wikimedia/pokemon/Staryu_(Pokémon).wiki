'''Staryu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヒトデマン''' ''Hitodeman'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Starmie}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]].

==Biology==
Staryu is a golden-brown sea star-like Pokémon with five appendages. These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's left "leg". If any of Staryu's appendages are lost, it can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact. The core resembles a red jewel and is similar to a {{wp|madreporite}}. Staryu is a natural prey of some species of Pokémon, including {{p|Lumineon}}. However, due to its regenerative abilities, being preyed upon does not negatively affect it.

When the sun goes down, the core glows its brightest. Many will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. The [[EP091|anime has shown]] that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|seafloors}}. There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in [[Pokémon Snap]].

==Other appearances==

[[File:Staryu SSB4.png|200px|thumb|Staryu in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]/[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Staryu will target one of the opponents, spin towards them and shoot {{m|Swift}}. It is rapid-fire, but it can easily be escaped from by Directional Influence; the player can still move around while getting hit by Swift.

====Melee trophy information====
''These starshape Pokémon that evolve into Starmie are found in large numbers at the seashore. At night, Staryu's red center glows and blinks on and off. It's said that as long as its red center remains, it can regrow its limbs. Whether it's related to {{p|Cleffa}}, another Pokémon with a vaguely star-shaped appearance, is unknown.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Star Shape Pokémon. It gathers in groups and flashes the red jewel in the center of its body in time to the twinkling of the stars in the night sky. If it loses appendages, it can regenerate them right away. It can also use {{m|Camouflage}}, which allows it to change its type to match the surrounding terrain. If a Water Stone is used on it, evolves into Starmie."''
====3DS/Wii U Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Water-type Pokémon, Staryu, greatly resembles a star. Exposing one to a Water Stone causes it to evolve into Starmie. Another star-shaped Pokémon, Cleffa, exists, but the two don't look all that similar. In Smash Bros., Staryu will attack foes with Swift. Anyone hit will be seeing stars! ''

'''PAL''': ''This Water-type Pokémon evolves into Starmie when you use a Water Stone. Its star shape makes it rather cute, but that doesn't mean Staryu's not a threat. Its Swift attack will pummel fighters with a flurry of stars. If you notice Staryu's aiming at you, quickly move up or down to get out of the line of fire. ''

==Trivia==
* In {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}}, Staryu is the only Pokémon with the [[Field Move]] {{m|Flash}}.
** Once Staryu serves its purpose with Flash, it cannot be captured again, except during the Kyogre mission.
* Staryu is one of fourteen Pokémon that one is able to collect [[foreign Pokédex entries]] for in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.
* Staryu shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Cleffa}}. They are both known as the Star Shape Pokémon.
* Despite being a genderless Pokémon, Staryu and Starmie were programmed to learn Egg moves in {{2v2|Gold|Silver}}; however, due to being genderless, these were unobtainable. This was fixed in {{v2|Crystal}}.
** Also, they are one of the few genderless Pokémon able to learn {{m|Attract}} in [[Generation II]], along with {{p|Mew}}.
* Staryu can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Shellder}}. Both of them are {{type|Water}} {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}} whose only evolutionary event utilizes a [[Water Stone]] into their evolved forms, and gain a type upon evolution.
** They also have a chance of holding [[valuable items]], {{DL|Valuable items|Stardust}}/{{DL|Valuable items|Star Piece}} and {{DL|Valuable items|Pearl}}/{{DL|Valuable items|Big Pearl}}, respectively. Staryu is exclusive to {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|LeafGreen}} and {{pkmn|X and Y|X}}, while Shellder is exclusive to {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|FireRed}} and {{pkmn|X and Y|Y}}, with both Pokémon found by fishing in the same locations in their respective versions.
* [[PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond]] erroneously refers to Staryu as a male, despite it being a genderless Pokémon.

===Origin===
Staryu's design is based on a {{wp|starfish}}, likely a {{wp|common starfish}}. The large gem attached to its body is held on by a bracket similar to a ring mount.

====Name origin====
Staryu is derived from ''star'' (referring to its shape) and ''yu'' (possible corruption of ''you'', in opposition to the ''mie'' in {{p|Starmie}}). ''Yu'' is also the Chinese word for fish (魚)<!--, while ''mie'' means ''triple branch'' in Japanese, referring to the greater branching of {{p|Starmie}}'s arms (all I get for "mie" is simply "triple", so can we get a proper breakdown of how this works?)-->.

Hitodeman is probably derived from ヒトデ ''hitode'' ({{wp|starfish}}) and the English word ''man''.
