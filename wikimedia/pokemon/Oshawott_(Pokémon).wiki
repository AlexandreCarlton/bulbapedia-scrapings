'''Oshawott''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミジュマル''' ''Mijumaru'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Dewott}} starting at [[level]] 17, which evolves into {{p|Samurott}} starting at level 36.

Along with {{p|Snivy}} and {{p|Tepig}}, Oshawott is one of three [[starter Pokémon]] of [[Unova]] available at the beginning of {{game|Black and White|s|Pokémon Black, White}}, [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2|Black 2, and White 2]].

==Biology==
Oshawott is a bipedal sea otter-like Pokémon. It has a spherical white head with small, triangular dark-blue ears on the sides. Oshawott's eyes are dark and its dark orange nose is shaped like a horizontal oval. Several freckles cover its cheeks which may be premature whiskers, and two pointed teeth can be seen when it opens its mouth. The light blue fur on its body forms bubble shapes around its neck. Its arms are white and rounded, while its feet are dark blue with three toes each. It also possesses a rudder-like dark blue tail. It carries a pale yellow seashell called a "[[Scalchop and seamitar|scalchop]]" on its belly. This shell is made of the same material as its claws, and is used for both battle and cracking hard berries.

==Trivia==
[[File:PokéSun May09 10.png|thumb|The three silhouettes on [[Pokémon Sunday]]]]
* Oshawott and its fellow [[Unova]] [[starter Pokémon]] were first revealed as silhouettes on the May 9, 2010 episode of [[Pokémon Sunday]]. They were later revealed in full in the June 2010 issue of [[CoroCoro]].
* Oshawott has the lowest base stat total of all {{type|Water}} starter Pokémon.
* Oshawott is the only {{type|Water}} starter Pokémon that is not a member of the {{egg3|Water 1}}.
* Oshawott was designed by [[Yūsuke Ōmura]].
* In {{g|Black and White}}, Oshawott, along with {{p|Snivy}} and {{p|Tepig}}, has the lowest [[experience]] yield of all Pokémon, with a base value of 28. This was done specifically for the first two battles of the games, so the player's starter wouldn't level up after defeating [[Bianca]] and thus have a level advantage over [[Cheren]].
** From {{g|Black 2 and White 2}} onward, their base experience yield was raised to 62 to bring them in line with the other [[starter Pokémon]] in the series.

===Origin===
Oshawott is based on a {{wp|sea otter}} pup and {{wp|samurai}}<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20101228065540/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index5.html (archived link)</ref>. The way that Oshawott's [[Scalchop and seamitar|scalchop]] rests on its belly resembles the way otters look when cracking open shells to eat. This scalchop also holds similarities with {{wp|Japanese war fan}}s, which were often used by samurai for defensive purposes. [[Ken Sugimori]] said that Oshawott and its {{p|Dewott|evolution}}s were the hardest for the team to design during production, as conceptualizing its {{p|Samurott|evolution}}s were difficult. They eventually settled on a samurai theme, and a trip to an aquarium inspired them to incorporate elements of sea lions.<ref>http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pia_information_begins_to_surface</ref>

====Name origin====
Oshawott may be a combination of ''ocean'', ''shell'', ''water'', ''wash'', and ''{{wp|otter}}''.

Mijumaru may be a combination of 水 ''mizu'' (water) or 未熟 ''mijuku'' (naive or immature) and 丸 ''maru'' (round). ''Maru'' is also a common suffix in male Japanese names. ''Miju'' may also refer to an otter named ''Mijbil'', the subject of an autobiographical novel and movie called ''{{wp|Ring of Bright Water}}''.
