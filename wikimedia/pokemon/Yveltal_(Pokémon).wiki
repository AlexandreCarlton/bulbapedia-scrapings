'''Yveltal''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イベルタル''' ''Yveltal'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Chespin}}, {{p|Fennekin}}, {{p|Froakie}}, and {{p|Xerneas}}, it was the first [[Generation VI]] Pokémon to be revealed to the public on January 8, 2013 as part of the {{DL|Nintendo Direct|Pokémon Direct}} broadcast.

Yveltal is the [[game mascot]] of {{pkmn|X and Y|Pokémon Y}}, appearing on the boxart. It is a member of the [[aura trio]] with {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Zygarde}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Yveltal Cocoon.png|thumb|left|250px|Yveltal in its cocoon form]]
Yveltal is a large Pokémon with avian and draconic traits. Its body is dark in coloration and is adorned with grayish patterns along the underside. Yveltal's wings have three spikes on each extending along the bottom edges, close to where they meet the body. There are five large claws on each appendage, three of which curve inwards. Yveltal's underside is bright red, with branching, black markings. Similar markings are present on Yveltal's head and neck.

Yveltal has a pointed, beak-like snout. Black horns extend from above its blue eyes, with a sharply curved portion pointing forward and thinner prongs facing the rear. A feathery gray ruff encircles its neck and billows out over its back. Yveltal has small, birdlike legs with powerful talons. Like the rest of the underside, the legs are red with black adornments, and the talons are gray. Each foot has two toes facing forward and one pointing backwards. When Yveltal's wings and tail are fully extended, Yveltal resembles the Latin alphabet letter Y.

Yveltal has the power to absorb life energy. When it reaches the end of its lifespan, it expands its wings and steals all of the life energy of every living thing around it before transforming into a cocoon to sleep for 1,000 years. Yveltal is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Oblivion Wing}}.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''With its wings spread wide, this Legendary Pokémon looks just like the letter Y. Since its name also starts with the same letter, it's difficult to imagine a more appropriate mascot for Pokémon Y. Apparently, when Yveltal's life comes to an end, it will absorb the life force of all living things— here's to a long and healthy life! ''

'''PAL''': ''With its wings spread wide, this Legendary Pokémon looks just like the letter Y.

==Trivia==
* Yveltal has the same stat distribution as {{p|Xerneas}}.
* Yveltal, along with Xerneas, was designed by art designers [[Ken Sugimori]] and [[Yusuke Ohmura]]. Initial design for the two Legendary Pokémon was started by Sugimori, but he encountered "[[wp:Writer's block|artist's block]]", having a hard time coming up with concepts. For the first time, he gave the work over to another designer, Ohmura. Ohmura furthered the designs, after which Sugimori resumed to finish them.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20141031160627/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/55616/ken-sugimori-got-artists-block-during-pokemon-x-and-y-development/ Ken Sugimori got 'artist's block' during Pokemon X and Y development]. Official Nintendo Magazine. Published 24 October 2013.</ref>

===Origin===
Yveltal's appearance is based on an avian in the shape of the letter Y, and as such has many similarities to the {{wp|long-tailed widowbird}}. It may be based on any number of figures from mythology, such as the Celtic death-goddess {{wp|Morrigan}}, which often takes the form of a raven, or Norse mythological figures such as {{wp|Hræsvelgr}}, which takes the form of an eagle and sits at the end of the world, or the Hawk {{wp|Veðrfölnir and eagle|Veðrfölnir or the unnamed eagle}} that resides at the top of the world tree {{wp|Yggdrasil}}. Yveltal also may draw inspiration from {{wp|carrion}} birds such as {{wp|Carrion Crow|crows}} and {{wp|vulture}}s. Additionally, it bears a striking resemblance to a species of fungus known as "{{wp|Clathrus archeri|devil's fingers}}."

====Name origin====
Yveltal comes from the letter {{wp|Y}}. It may also be derived from ''[[wiktionary:yvel|yvel]]'' (a {{wp|Middle English}} spelling of ''{{wp|evil}}'') and ''{{wp|quetzal}}'' or ''{{wp|talon}}''.
