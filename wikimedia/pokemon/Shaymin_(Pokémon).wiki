'''Shaymin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''シェイミ''' ''Shaymin'') is a {{type|Grass}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from another Pokémon, it has a [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Shaymin|second Forme]] activated by using a [[Gracidea|Gracidea flower]] in the daytime. Its original Forme, '''Land Forme''', will then become the {{2t|Grass|Flying}}-type '''Sky Forme'''. Shaymin's Sky Forme will revert into its Land Forme during the night or when {{status|frozen}}. Other circumstances may also cause it to revert<!--Please do not expand here-->.

Shaymin was officially revealed in February 2008, when it was listed as a star of ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. In early June of the same year, its Sky Forme was revealed.

==Biology==

[[File:Shaymin Sky Forme toxic petals.png|thumb|left|250px|Sky Forme Shaymin's petals after absorbing toxins]]
Shaymin is a small, white hedgehog-like Pokémon. In Land Forme, it has green grass-like fur on its back and a pink flower with two leaves on each side of its head, which resembles the [[Gracidea]] flower. Several Gracidea-like flowers also appear on its back whenever it feels comfortable, but when it senses an impending danger, it rapidly hides it back. Its legs are short and its underside is plump. Shaymin is the smallest Mythical Pokémon to date.

In Sky Forme, it has a slender, canine appearance like that of a small reindeer. The fur on its back becomes a mohawk, and it has a red flower petal on the left side of its neck, resembling a scarf or cape. It has flat, white ears resembling wings, a small tuft of fur on the front of its neck, and a stumpy tail. Shaymin will change into Sky Forme and back if it touches a [[Gracidea]]. It reverts to Land Forme at night or if it is {{status|Freeze|frozen}}. Shaymin can instantly purify any polluted area of all impurities in the air and transform it into a lush field of flowers. It takes in the polluted air, purifies it inside its body, breaks it down into water and light, and releases the purified substance in a violent, explosive burst. Its power varies based on the type of pollution absorbed. Shaymin can also communicate with telepathy and sense the gratitude of others.

Each season, Shaymin gathers with others in a flower field somewhere and migrates from there. This behavior is called Flower Carrying because a new field of flowers grow where it lands. Shaymin is also attracted to areas where there is a lot of gratitude. Its personality is almost opposite with each form: in Land Forme, it is shy and easily scared, while in Sky Forme, it is courageous and playful. If wet, it shakes itself to dry itself off, and exhibits the behavior of scratching itself with a hind leg. Shaymin lives in fields of flowers. Since it camouflages by curling itself up, it can easily escape people's notice. It has been seen liking sweet food. Shaymin is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] to know {{m|Seed Flare}}.

===Major appearances===
====[[Shaymin (M11)]]====
Shaymin debuted in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]'', where it was fleeing from {{mov|Giratina}}, after enraging it in the [[Reverse World]]. Shaymin thought that Giratina wanted to eat it, but in reality, the Renegade Pokémon wanted to use Shaymin to utilize its {{m|Seed Flare}} to open a portal to the [[Pokémon world|real world]]. It premiered both of its Formes in the movie. Shaymin also made a minor appearance during the ending credits of ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', where it stood gazing upon the land on a tree branch. This Shaymin had the ability to {{pkmn2|Talking|talk}} via telepathy.

====Other====
Shaymin made its main series debut in ''[[DP168|Keeping In Top Forme!]]'', where [[Marley]] was protecting it from {{TRT}}.

Shaymin made its full debut in ''[[PS434|The Final Dimensional Duel IV]]''. [[Marley]] was introduced to it by a letter from {{adv|Professor Oak}}. In the [[Distortion World]], Shaymin tried its best not to get involved in a big clash that broke out between the rest of the [[Legendary Pokémon]]. [[Cyrus]] then caught Shaymin in his hands and showed the gratitude towards Shaymin that allowed it to transform into its Sky Forme. After [[Charon]] was arrested, Shaymin chose to stay with Marley.

{{main|Shaymin (TCG)}}
==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Shaymin appears in both Formes as a trophy in the 3DS version of the game. It also randomly appears on {{st|Unova Pokémon League}}, where it changes from Land to Sky Forme. It does not affect the battle in any way.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''When in its Land Forme, this Pokémon sports a fetching pink flower. In Sky Forme, it can take to the air with ease. This Legendary Pokémon is hard to find, but it can sense anyone with a grateful heart. This ability is where the name "Gratitude Pokémon" comes from.''

'''PAL''': ''No wonder this Mythical Pokémon is so hard to find! In its Land Forme, it looks just like a flowery patch of grass. Good luck spotting that in a field! Shaymin has two different forms, though, and in Sky Forme, it can fly. In both forms, Shaymin reacts to gratitude, hence its nickname: the Gratitude Pokémon.''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}: A tribe of {{p|Shaymin}} have made their home at near the trail leading to the top of the nearby [[Sky Peak]] mountain.

==Trivia==
* Land Forme Shaymin is the shortest Mythical Pokémon.
* Shaymin's Sky Forme has a different [[cry]] than its Land Forme.
** In [[Generation IV]], this cry cannot be played in the Pokédex, due to it only registering the first Forme encountered. As wild or traded Shaymin will be in Land Forme and Pokémon aren't registered in link battles, it is impossible to register a Sky Forme Shaymin.
** Despite this, the only cry used in [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]] is the one of its Land Forme.
* A Shaymin caught at the Flower Paradise in Pokémon Platinum will be a [[fateful encounter]] Pokémon.
* If a {{status|freeze|frozen}} Shaymin in Sky Forme is holding a [[Lum Berry]] or an [[Aspear Berry]], it will eat the Berry after transforming back to Land Forme.
* Despite being a [[Mythical Pokémon]], normal [[wild Pokémon]] battle music plays while battling it. It is the only Mythical Pokémon with this trait.
* In [[Generation VI]] and prior it is impossible to use Shaymin's Sky Forme in the [[Battle Spot]] or in online competitions that allow Mythical Pokémon. This is because only Pokémon stored in the [[PC]] can be used and Shaymin would revert to Land Forme as soon as deposited. In [[Generation VII]] this was changed so that Sky Forme can be deposited into the PC and only revert to Land Forme when withdrawn.

===Origin===
Shaymin is based on a {{wp|hedgehog}}. However, its white body and the grass-like fur on its back makes it somewhat resemble a {{wp|chia pet}} as well. Moreover, when Land Forme Shaymin blooms with flowers, as seen in the anime, Shaymin appears as a bouquet of flowers, emphasizing Shaymin's role as the Gratitude Pokémon.

Sky Forme Shaymin shares most of its traits with a small, young {{wp|terrier}}-type dog, but its sprightly behavior, its affinity for flowers, and its ability to fly bring to mind {{wp|fairy|fairies}}. Shaymin's Sky Forme has a few aspects that resemble that of a {{wp|reindeer}} as well.

====Name origin====
Shaymin may be a combination of 謝 ''xiè'' (Chinese for ''thanks/gratitude'') and 蝟 ''harinezumi'' (hedgehog). It may also involve ''shaman'' (a mystic) or ''stamen'' (a plant part). Alternatively, it may be a corruption of ם‎שמי‎ ''{{wp|Shamayim}}'' (Hebrew for ''heaven/sky''), correlating directly with Shaymin's Sky Forme.
