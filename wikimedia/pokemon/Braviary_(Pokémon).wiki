'''Braviary''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウォーグル''' ''Warrgle'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rufflet}} starting at [[level]] 54.

==Biology==
Braviary is a large, avian Pokémon with dark red feathers on its back and dark blue feathers on its underside. Its tail feathers are red, turning to yellow, and then blue at the tips. Braviary's legs are long and thick with yellow feet that each have a digit facing backward, and three facing forward. Each digit is tipped by a short, thick, black claw.

Braviary has a long, thick beak with a blue {{wp|cere}}. On either side of the cere are Braviary's eyes, which are black with small white pupils. Sprouting from above the eyes are three large, white feathers. At the base of the feathers is a red, three-pointed design that is spread across all three feathers. On each side of Braviary's face, sprouting out from behind the feathers on its forehead, are an additional three white feathers pointing horizontally and downward. Behind the three feathers on its head is a large plume of white feathers, extending most of the way down its neck. These features combined resemble a {{wp|Native American}} {{wp|war bonnet}}.

Braviary is extremely aggressive, but for noble reasons. It will fight fiercely to help and protect its friends. Even if it is injured or has its life threatened, it will still fight. The more scars it has on its front, the more respect it gets from its peers. Scars on its back will bring it ridicule however. It has earned the nickname "hero of the skies" due to its extreme dedication for its friends. Aiding its valiance, Braviary is extremely strong, capable of lifting a car and flying with it.

==Trivia==
* Braviary represents {{wp|August}} in the [[Unova]] [[horoscope]].
* Braviary and {{p|Rufflet}} can be seen as counterparts to {{p|Mandibuzz}} and {{p|Vullaby}}. Braviary and Mandibuzz share a base stat total of 510, evolve from their pre-evolutions starting at 54, and are both part {{t|Flying}}. Braviary and Rufflet are exclusive to {{game3|Black and White|White|s}}, {{game|Black and White|s|White 2|2}}, and {{game3|Sun and Moon|Sun|s}} while Mandibuzz and Vullaby are to Black, Black 2 and Moon. Whereas Braviary and Rufflet can only be male, Mandibuzz and Vullaby can only be female.
* Braviary and {{p|Vanillish}} weigh as much as {{ga|Lyra}}.

===Origin===
Braviary may be based on the {{wp|bald eagle}}. Its color scheme may be inspired by the red, white, and blue of the {{wp|flag of the United States}}. Its design also may be influenced by {{wp|Native American}} culture. This may be reflected in the feathers on its head, resembling {{wp|war bonnet}}s.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110402003550/http://shellspider.blog101.fc2.com/blog-entry-562.html Interview in Nintendo Dream Issue 205 (May 2011), via Fan blog post (Japanese)]</ref>

====Name origin====
Braviary is a corruption of ''bravery'' and a combination of ''brave'' and ''{{wp|aviary}}''. "Home of the brave" is a lyric found in the "{{wp|The Star-Spangled Banner}}", the national anthem of the {{wp|United States}}. ''Brave'' may also refer to the term used for {{wp|Native Americans in the United States|Native American}} warriors, as in some tribes, the {{wp|eagle}} is a sacred animal.

Warrgle is a combination of ''{{wp|war}}'' or ''{{wp|warrior}}'' and ''eagle''. It may also involve ''warble'', a sound a bird makes.
