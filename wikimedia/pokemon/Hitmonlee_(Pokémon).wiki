'''Hitmonlee''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サワムラー''' ''Sawamular'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Tyrogue}} starting at [[level]] 20 when Tyrogue's {{stat|Attack}} is higher than its {{stat|Defense}}. It is one of {{p|Tyrogue}}'s [[Hitmons|final forms]], the others being {{p|Hitmonchan}} and {{p|Hitmontop}}.

==Biology==
Hitmonlee is a humanoid Pokémon with an ovoid body. Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black rings around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs, with three fingers and three clawed toes respectively. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow markings. It is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.

Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides and gives it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rare in the wild, it is primarily found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas.}}

==Trivia==
* Hitmonlee and {{p|Hitmonchan}} are the only Pokémon not previously related through an evolution family that later gained a shared {{p|Tyrogue|pre-evolution}}.

===Origin===
Hitmonlee may be a personification of {{wp|taekwondo}}, a sport that focuses on kick attacks. Due to its lack of a head, Hitmonlee bears resemblance to mythical {{wp|headless men}} such as the {{wp|Xing Tian}} and the Hindu demon {{wp|Kabandha}}. Based on its Japanese name and kicking attribute, Hitmonlee may also represent Japanese kickboxer {{wp|Tadashi Sawamura}}. From the Japanese names of its Abilities—{{a|Limber|Flexible}}, {{a|Reckless|Life-Risking}} and {{a|Unburden|Acrobatics}}—Hitmonlee may also be based on an {{wp|acrobatics|acrobat}}.

====Name origin====
Hitmonlee is a combination of ''hit'', ''monster'', and ''Lee'' (a reference to {{wp|Bruce Lee}}). The name is also related to {{p|Hitmonchan}} and {{p|Hitmontop}}, both of which are parallel evolutions to it as of [[Generation II]].

Sawamular is derived from {{wp|Tadashi Sawamura}}, a famous kickboxer.
