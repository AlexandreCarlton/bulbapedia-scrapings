'''Feebas''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヒンバス''' ''Hinbass'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Milotic}} when [[level]]ed up with its {{OBP|Beauty|condition}} condition high enough or when [[trade]]d holding a [[Prism Scale]] ([[Generation V]] onwards).

==Biology==
Feebas is a shabby, old-looking fish-like Pokémon with a light brown body covered in dark, irregular spots. It has large, deep-set eyes and big, pink lips. The tail and pectoral fins are dull blue and tattered in appearance. The dorsal fin is triangular with a hole in the middle. Due to its poor appearance, it is largely ignored by {{pkmn|Trainer}}s and researchers alike. However, this hardy Pokémon is capable of eating anything and living anywhere. It is often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|weed-choked ponds}}, even if only a little water is available. While there are many of this Pokémon in existence, populations tend to cluster in small areas. Once found, its dull wits make it easy to capture.

==In the anime==

===Major appearances===
A Feebas appeared in ''[[DP021|Ya See We Want An Evolution!]]'', under the ownership of [[Haley]]. It was nicknamed the loveliest Feebas of all. Haley's Feebas proved itself to be a strong Pokémon without even evolving.

In ''[[DP043|Malice in Wonderland!]]'', a Feebas, which later evolved into a {{p|Milotic}}, appeared under the ownership of [[Johanna]]. However, it turned out to be an illusion created by {{p|Mismagius}}.

===Minor appearances===
Feebas debuted in ''[[AG075|Whiscash and Ash]]'', where it bit [[Jessie]]'s hair.

A Feebas appeared in ''[[DP138|Strategy Begins at Home!]]'' while {{TRT}} was [[fishing]] for {{p|Goldeen}}.

A Feebas appeared in ''[[DP140|Historical Mystery Tour!]]''.

A Feebas appeared in ''[[SM033|Big Sky, Small Fry!]]''. {{an|Lana}} caught it whilst fishing and gave it to the [[master fisherman]] so she and {{Ash}} could use his boat.

==In the manga==

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Feefee}}
{{adv|Ruby}} obtained a Feebas in ''[[PS206|Not So Fetching Feebas]]'' after she took a liking to him while he was fishing at {{rt|119|Hoenn}}. After protecting him from a wild {{p|Zangoose}} and {{p|Seviper}}, Ruby was forced to keep her on his team, nicknaming her Feefee. She later evolved into a Milotic in ''[[PS266|It All Ends Now VII]]'' after Ruby had declared that she was beautiful despite her looks.

===In the Pokémon Battle Frontier manga===
{{OBP|Enta|CBF}} had a Feebas which evolved into a Milotic after the battle with [[Dome Ace Tucker]].

===In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure! manga===
[[Mitsumi]] has a Milotic which evolved from Feebas, shown in a flashback in ''[[DPAS4|Mitsumi's Wish]]''.

==Trivia==
* Feebas has several similarities to {{p|Magikarp}}:
** Though its level-up moves are exactly the same as those of Magikarp, Feebas can learn moves from [[TM]]s and [[HM]]s, hatch from an Egg with [[Egg Move]]s, and learn new moves via Move Tutors, making it slightly more useful in battle.
** Feebas shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with Magikarp. They are both known as the Fish Pokémon.
** Feebas and Magikarp have almost identical stats. However, Feebas has a higher {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Defense}}, while Magikarp has a higher {{stat|Special Attack}} and {{stat|Defense}}. Both Attack and Defense stats for Feebas and Magikarp are reversed.
** They share the largest base stat total increase of all Pokémon when they evolve: 340 (from 200 to 540).
** They both change appearances drastically after evolution, evolving into serpentine, dragon-like Pokémon.
* Feebas is the only Pokémon that needs a modification of its Contest stats for it to evolve.
** Although Contest conditions are a hidden stat in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, {{game|Black and White|s}}, {{game|Black and White|s 2|Pokémon Black 2 and White 2}}, and {{g|X and Y}}, a Feebas that has maximum {{OBP|Beauty|condition}} will still evolve in these games. The [[Prism Scale]], introduced in Generation V, was created due to the fact that there is no legitimate way to raise the Beauty of a Feebas created in the Generation V games, whereas with FireRed and LeafGreen, a trade to Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald was all that was required, and a haircut or grooming by [[Daisy Oak]] or the [[Haircut brothers]] is all that is required in HeartGold and SoulSilver.
** This also makes Feebas the only Pokémon that can evolve into a single stage through multiple methods in the [[core series]].
* The probability of finding a [[water tile]] with Feebas on {{rt|119|Hoenn}} is approximately 1/73, with six possible [[fishing]] spots on 436 water tiles. In [[Mt. Coronet]], it is 1/132, with four possible fishing spots on 528 water tiles.

===Origin===
As its name suggests, Feebas is probably based on a {{wp|bass (fish)|bass}}, possibly the {{wp|largemouth bass}}. It also resembles the {{wp|marine hatchetfish}}. Its ugly appearance makes it appear to be also based from the concept of ugliness, appearing to don a wash of ugly makeup. It also seems to be based on the classic {{wp|fairy tale}}, ''{{wp|The Ugly Duckling}}'', where a small and feeble "ugly duckling", treated as an outcast by other animals, blossoms into a beautiful {{wp|swan}}.

====Name origin====
Feebas is a combination of ''feeble'' (weak) and ''{{wp|bass (fish)|bass}}''. ''Feebas'' is also phonetically similar to ''phoebus'' (Latin for ''shining one''), possibly alluding to {{p|Milotic}}, its evolved form.

Hinbass is a combination of 貧 ''hin'' (poor) and ''bass''. ''Hin'' may also come from the words ''hind'' (located at the rear) or ''hinder''.
