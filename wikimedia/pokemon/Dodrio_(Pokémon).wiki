'''Dodrio''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ドードリオ''' ''Dodorio'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Doduo}} starting at [[level]] 31.

==Biology==
Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokémon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black feathered, V-shaped crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its heads and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three toes in front and one in back. There are sharp claws on each toe. Males have black necks, whereas females have brown necks; both genders have brown legs.

Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality, representing and expressing sorrow, anger and joy respectively. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion it may over think and analyze a situation, causing itself to be immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the heads are well known to squabble with one another. Often they will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of the heads gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. Another adaption it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. While two are asleep, one will stand guard and look out for any approaching enemies. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous, and going near it may result in a severe pecking.

Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grassy plains}}, even in arid seasons with little rainfall.

==Trivia==
[[File:Dodrio Fly Stad.png|thumb|Dodrio flying in {{Eng|Pokémon Stadium}}]]
* While one of its heads is saying something in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]], the others say ''me too'' or ''mine too'', but its pre-evolved form's other head will not.
* Dodrio is the only Pokémon whose National Pokédex number is the whole number portion of its weight in kilograms.
* Not including the intro video, Dodrio was the first Pokémon to appear in the flesh in the anime (all others before that were either dreamt of by {{Ash}}, or else shown on the TV in his room).
* According to its Pokédex entries, {{p|Doduo}} can run at 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h), while Dodrio can only run at nearly 40&nbsp;mph (60&nbsp;km/h). However, Dodrio's base {{stat|Speed}} stat is higher.
* Dodrio is featured in the [[Generation III]] wireless mini-game, [[Dodrio Berry Picking]], where it is required that players own a Dodrio to be able to play.
* Before [[Generation IV]], the necks of normal Dodrio were beige (which became the female neck color), while its {{p|Doduo|pre-evolution's}} necks were black (which became the male neck color).

===Origin===
Despite its name, Dodrio seems like it has more in common with {{wp|ostrich}}es than {{wp|dodo}}s. It also seems to show some similarity to the {{wp|Moa}}, an extinct flightless bird, and the {{wp|Emu}}, another flightless bird. It also resembles the {{wp|Kiwi}} in some ways as well. Its crests may mean it may have been based on {{wp|cassowary|cassowaries}}.

====Name origin====
Dodrio is a combination of ''{{wp|dodo}}'' (an extinct, flightless bird) and ''trio'' (group of three).

Dodorio may be a combination of ドードー ''dodo'' and トリオ ''trio''. To note, ''dori'' may be a reference to 鳥 ''tori'' (bird).
