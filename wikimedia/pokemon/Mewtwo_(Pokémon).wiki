'''Mewtwo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミュウツー''' ''Mewtwo'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into two different forms: '''Mega Mewtwo X''' using [[Mewtwonite X]] and '''Mega Mewtwo Y''' using [[Mewtwonite Y]].

It is a member of the [[Mew duo]] along with {{p|Mew}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Mega Mewtwo X arm.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Mega Mewtwo X stretching its arm.]] 
Mewtwo is a [[artificial Pokémon|Pokémon created by science]]. It is a bipedal, humanoid creature with some feline features. It is primarily gray with a long, purple tail. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base, but thins before ending in a small bulb.

Mega Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from V-shaped ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple growths over its shoulders. Its torso is smooth and small compared to its long, bulky limbs, and a Y-shaped line connects the collar and underbelly. Its forearms and thighs each have two raised ridges, and its digits are now longer and thinner. The tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs.

In comparison, Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail. On its head it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to base of each and crossing over the top of its head, with empty space inside. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous, and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a {{wp|sternum}} replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two.

Mewtwo was created after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments based on {{p|Mew}}. It is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lack compassion, and strike fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. In the first movie, {{OBP|Mewtwo|original series}} exemplified these vicious characteristics and was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy and mind control. However, it was [[Mewtwo Returns|later shown]] to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another {{OBP|Mewtwo|Best Wishes series}} in the anime shared its aversion to contact with others, but was much less belligerent. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. It is also capable of materializing psychic waves in the form of its [[signature move]], {{m|Psystrike}}. Though {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rarely seen}} in the wild, it is said to be resting in a dark cave somewhere.

==History==
According to the [[Pokémon Mansion journals|scientific logs]] found in the {{ka|Pokémon Mansion}} of [[Cinnabar Island]], Mewtwo was born of a pregnant {{p|Mew}}, found deep in the jungles of [[Guyana]], whose embryo had been tampered with to alter its DNA. It was held and studied in the mansion where [[Mr. Fuji|a scientist]] performed horrific gene-splicing experiments that made it vicious and extremely powerful. It eventually broke free of the Mansion, destroying it in the process, and fled. It can be encountered in [[Cerulean Cave]], accessible only after a Trainer has proven his or her skill at the [[Indigo Plateau]].

====Major appearances====
=====[[Mewtwo (original series)]]=====
While Mewtwo has been the Pokémon of focus of a {{pkmn|movie}} and a special, it also made brief appearances in ''[[EP063|The Battle of the Badge]]'' and ''[[EP065|Showdown at the Po-ké Corral]]'' in its body armor. The first instance was when {{an|Giovanni}} used it to battle [[Gary's Arcanine]] and {{DL|Gary Oak|Nidoking}}. The second time was when Mewtwo totaled Giovanni's headquarters and flew off.

Mewtwo made further appearances during the openings of ''[[M06|Jirachi Wish Maker]]'' standing on a rooftop wearing a cape, and in the intro of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'' and ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', chasing a {{p|Mew}}.

=====[[Mewtwo (Best Wishes series)]]=====
Another Mewtwo and the [[Mega Evolution]] Mega Mewtwo Y debuted in the special episode ''[[SS026|Mewtwo — Prologue to Awakening]]'', a prologue to ''[[M16|Genesect and the Legend Awakened]]''. In the special, Mewtwo escaped from [[Mewtwo's creators|its creators]] and fought against a [[Pokémon poacher|Pokémon hunter]] named [[Dirk]], while [[Virgil]] helped protect it.

It reappeared in ''Genesect and the Legend Awakened'' as both its normal form and Mega Mewtwo Y. At the beginning of the film, Mewtwo encountered the [[Genesect Army]], who were looking for their home after being recreated. After a short conflict, the Army departed, and Mewtwo followed them to [[New Tork City]]. It met {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}, then got into a great conflict with the Red Genesect leading the Army.

In a fierce battle that wiped out almost all of Red's Pokémon, Mewtwo was finally defeated by [[Red's Charizard]] after it Mega Evolved into Mega Charizard X. Red then proceeded to capture Mewtwo, making his collection of the 150 known Pokémon complete.

Together, {{adv|Red}} and Blaine battled with Mewtwo, which eventually ended in its capture via [[Master Ball]] in ''[[PS035|And Mewtwo... Three!]]''.

==Trivia==
* One of the [[Pokémon Mansion journals]] states that Mewtwo's birthday is February 6.
** The same journal implies that Mew was impregnated with the modified clone, as in real life cloning. All other depictions show Mewtwo being grown using laboratory equipment.
* Mewtwo comes before {{p|Mew}} in the [[Pokédex]] despite being created from its modified DNA.
* Mewtwo was the first Pokémon seen in the English dub, as it appears at the very beginning of the [[Pokémon Theme|first dub opening]].
* Mewtwo is tied with Mew for the most anime opening appearances of any Legendary Pokémon, with seven in Japan.
* Mewtwo is depicted on the door of [[Bill]]'s lighthouse in ''[[EP013|Mystery at the Lighthouse]]'' despite having only been seen by [[Team Rocket scientists|its creators]] and [[Team Rocket]] at that point in the anime. Similarly, Mewtwo's sprite was depicted as a portrait in Viridian Gym, despite being a public area.
* The island country of {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Mewtwo as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Mewtwo on the reverse side and the nation's crest on the obverse.
* Mewtwo was originally depicted as the only member of its species, being a clone of Mew. In the {{pkmn|anime}} and {{pkmn|manga}}, however, it is implied that multiple Mewtwo have been created.
* Mega Mewtwo Y was the first [[Mega Evolution]] revealed to the public and the first to appear in the anime, even before Mega Evolution was announced.
** Prior to the announcement of Mega Evolution, Mega Mewtwo Y was referred to as its 「覚醒した姿」 ''Awakened Form''.<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130618180918/http://www.pokemon.co.jp/info/2013/06/130615_m02.html?a001=news ポケモン映画最新作『神速のゲノセクト ミュウツー覚醒』へと続くオリジナルストーリーが、テレビで放送決定！]</ref> This term was also used in the {{ma|Genesect and the Legend Awakened|manga adaptation of the movie}}.
* Mewtwo's Mega Evolutions are tied with {{me|Rayquaza}} for the highest base stat total of all Pokémon, with 780.
** Mega Mewtwo X has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} of all Pokémon, as well as the highest single base stat and base {{stat|Special Attack}} of all {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon.
*** Mega Mewtwo X's Attack increase is the largest single stat increase of all Mega Evolutions, at 80 points.
** Mega Mewtwo Y has the highest base Special Attack of all Pokémon and the highest single base stat of all Psychic-type Pokémon.
* Mewtwo and {{p|Charizard}} are currently the only Pokémon with two Mega Evolutions.

===Origin===
Like {{p|Mew}}, Mewtwo has some {{wp|feline}} characteristics, but its body structure is much larger as a result of {{wp|gene splicing}}. Mewtwo also has some characteristics of a {{wp|grey alien}} and a {{wp|salamander}}.

Mega Mewtwo Y, much like {{p|Mew}}, has characteristics of a vertebrate {{wp|embryo}}.

====Name origin====
Mewtwo is a combination of ''{{p|Mew}}'' (the Pokémon it originated from) and ''two'' (indicating that it is a clone). It may also be a play on the word ''{{wp|mutant}}'' (ミュータント).
