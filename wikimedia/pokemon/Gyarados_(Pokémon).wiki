'''Gyarados''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ギャラドス''' ''Gyarados'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Magikarp}} starting at [[level]] 20. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Gyarados''' using the [[Gyaradosite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Gyarados Mouth Closed.png|thumb|left|230px|Gyarados with its mouth closed]]
Gyarados is a serpentine Chinese dragon-like Pokémon. It is mostly blue, with a yellow underbelly and yellow spots along its body. It has a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head and four white, dorsal fins. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four canine teeth. It has one barbel on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and the same color as the main body on a male. Gyarados's tailfin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.

Mega Gyarados is bulkier than its previous form. The fins on its face, its barbels, and its crest are now considerably longer. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales that run down its side with a single red stripe below them. Two large white fins appear on its back, similar to those on its face. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, except for the one near the tail. Instead, it now has four white, pointed fins near is tail: two on its back and two on its underside.

Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in the anime that it can leap huge distances both [[SS002|from the water]] and [[XY133|from the ground]], usually several times its own body length. Its fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is infamously known for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies, and is attracted to violence. In addition, Gyarados is also notoriously difficult to tame even after it is captured by the {{pkmn|Trainer}}, usually requiring an exceptional amount of work in taming it until it can obey its Trainer. Gyarados usually lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|large bodies of water}}, such as lakes and ponds or even seas and oceans.

Its pre-evolution form is Magikarp."''

==Trivia==

* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Gyarados' name was ''Skulkraken'', a combination of ''skull'' and ''{{wp|kraken}}'' (a mythological sea monster).
* Gyarados is tied with {{p|Magikarp}} and {{p|Regigigas}} for being the lowest level Pokémon encountered in the wild, as well as also tied with Magikarp for the highest level Pokémon encountered in the wild. In {{game|Black and White|s 2|Black 2 and White 2}}, Gyarados can be found at levels ranging from level 1 to 100 in the [[Nature Preserve]] by using a {{DL|Fishing|Super Rod}} in rippling water.
* In [[Generation II]] and [[Generation IV]], Gyarados is the first of only two [[Shiny Pokémon]] to be integrated into a game's plot (the second was {{mdc|Celebi|2}} in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}).
* Gyarados is tied with {{p|Milotic}} for the greatest increase in base stat total after evolving, at 340 points.
* As of [[Generation VII]], Gyarados and its pre-evolution's [[Egg Group]] combination ({{egg|Water 2}} and {{egg|Dragon}}) is unique.
* As of X and Y, Gyarados is used by three of the nine Pokémon League Champions, being used by {{ga|Blue}}, [[Lance]], and [[Wallace]], making it the most popular Pokémon among Pokémon League Champions thus far (although Blue does not always have a Gyarados, depending on the player's starter Pokémon). However, Blue is the only one to use it in the [[Pokémon World Tournament]].
** Gyarados is also a popular Pokémon among [[Gym Leader]]s, being used by Blue, [[Clair]], and [[Crasher Wake]].
** Gyarados has also been used twice by two villainous Team Leaders. The first instance was [[Cyrus]] and the second instance was [[Lysandre]].
* In many ways, Gyarados is the counterpart of {{p|Milotic}}. Both are the serpentine evolved forms of weak fish Pokémon, and both appear in times of conflict, Gyarados to destroy, Milotic to becalm. Both have base stat totals of 540, the only difference being the distribution of their {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Special Attack}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats.
* Mega Gyarados has highest Attack stat of all {{type|Water}} Pokémon.
* Mega Gyarados is tied with {{p|Hoopa}} [[List of Pokémon with form differences|Unbound]] as the tallest Dark-type Pokémon.
** Mega Gyarados is also tied with {{p|Hoopa}} [[List of Pokémon with form differences|Unbound]] and {{p|Umbreon}} for having the highest Special Defense of all {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
It appears to be based on a sea dragon or {{wp|sea serpent}} and {{wp|chinese dragon}}. Gyarados is partially based on a legend about how carp that leapt over the Dragon Gate would become dragons. Several waterfalls and cataracts in China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate. This is referenced by [[Pokémon Snap]], as the player needs to get a Magikarp into a waterfall to evolve it into Gyarados. This legend is an allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles (which can be tied to the fact that Gyarados' pre-evolution, Magikarp, could possibly take a lot of drive and effort to legitimately evolve into Gyarados).

Its {{type|Flying}} may be a reference of {{wp|koinobori}}, a carp-shaped {{wp|wind sock}} traditionally flown to celebrate the {{wp|Children's Day (Japan)|Children's Day}} in Japan, formerly called ''Tango no Sekku'' (端午の節句).

===Name origin===
Gyarados may derive from 虐殺 ''gyakusatsu'' (massacre/slaughter) or 逆境 ''gyakkyō'' (hardship/adversity)—both words relate to the creature's violent nature and the hardship it experienced before evolving. In addition, 逆 ''gyaku'' means "reverse" or "contrary", possibly referring to how Gyarados evolves from a weak Pokémon to one capable of destroying entire cities, and, in legend, how the carp goes against the flow of the waterfall in order to reach the top. It may also involve 嵐 ''arashi'' (storm) or 争い ''arasoi'' (conflict, referencing on how it appeared during wars). The last part may be from ドス ''dosu'' (onomatopoeia for the piercing of flesh, again owing to Gyarados' violent nature).
