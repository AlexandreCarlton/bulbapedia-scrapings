'''Sharpedo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サメハダー''' ''Samehader'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Carvanha}} starting at [[level]] 30. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Sharpedo''' using the [[Sharpedonite‎]].

==Biology==
Sharpedo is a torpedo-shaped shark Pokémon covered with tiny, sharp {{wp|denticles}}. It has a large mouth filled with triangular, sharp teeth. Its eyes are a deep red color and glow in the dark. It has two gill slits situated directly behind each eye. It is mostly dark blue with a white underbelly. There is a yellow star-shaped marking on its snout, and another star marking on its rear. It has a tall {{wp|dorsal fin}} with two notches cut into it, with a {{wp|Fish anatomy#Fins|pelvic fin}} directly opposite it. Its two pectoral fins are arranged so that they resemble the fins on the back of a torpedo.

As Mega Sharpedo, the fangs in its mouth have transformed, and the horns that have sprouted from its nose are fangs that can be regrown countless times. The yellow patterns on its body are old resurfaced scars that were carved in battle, causing it sharp pain and suffering. With explosive propulsion, it can exceed 125mph in an instant.

Sharpedo swallows and shoots out jets of seawater from its rear, which allows it to swim 75 to 80 miles per hour. However, it is unable to swim long distances. It is feared and known as Bully of the Sea, or Gangs of the Sea as a group, due to its sharp teeth. It was once prized for its dorsal fin as a food item, and has been a victim of overfishing. Its fangs can rip through iron and steel, being able to tear apart a supertanker into pieces. When its fangs fall out, they grow back immediately. It is very sensitive to the scent of blood. It lives in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|sea.}} Sharpedo is known to prey on {{p|Wailmer}}, particularly small ones.

==Trivia==
* In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, if a player {{m|surf}}s on a Sharpedo, it will have its own model, and it can surf significantly faster than other Pokémon. However, it is impossible to fish while surfing on a Sharpedo, the game stating that "It's too risky to let go now!" An NPC on [[Hoenn Route 124|Route 124]] refers to this as "speed surfing" if the player admits ignorance to her question.
* Sharpedo shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Hydreigon}}. They are both known as the Brutal Pokémon.
* In a demo version of Ruby and Sapphire shown at Pokémon Festa 2002 in Japan, players started with a level 12 Sharpedo with no Ability. This was most likely done for the purpose of the demo only.
* Sharpedo's evolutionary line can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Camerupt}}'s family. Both of them are dual-type Pokémon, both lines have identical base stat totals per evolutionary stage, both of their final evolutions are used by [[Team Aqua]] Leader [[Archie]] and [[Team Magma]] Leader [[Maxie]], respectively, and both of their final evolutions can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]].
* Sharpedo's Pokédex entry for Moon states "It has a sad history. In the past, its dorsal fin was a treasured foodstuff, so this Pokémon became a victim of overfishing." This is likely a reference to {{wp|shark finning}} in the real world, where wild sharks are caught, have their fins cut off, and the still alive shark is thrown back in the water to die. Because of the practice, many species of sharks around the world are listed as threatened or endangered by the IUCN.

===Origin===
Sharpedo is based on a {{wp|shark}} with the body of a {{wp|torpedo}}. It also looks like a shark that has been cut in half. Its general body shape is also similar to an {{wp|ocean sunfish}}. Both fish are known for their sandpaper-like skin. Mega Sharpedo seems to also be based on a {{wp|sawshark}} or {{wp|sawfish}}.

====Name origin====
Sharpedo is a combination of ''{{wp|shark}}'' and ''{{wp|torpedo}}''. It may also involve ''sharp'', referring to its fins and {{a|Rough Skin}} Ability.

Samehader may be a combination of 鮫 ''same'' (shark) and 肌荒れ ''hada-are'' (rough skin). It may also be a corruption of 鮫肌 ''samehada'' (rough skin), referring to its Ability.
