'''Sawk''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ダゲキ''' ''Dageki'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, but it is considered to be a counterpart of {{p|Throh}}.

==Biology==
Sawk is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon with a lean, blue body and rocky skin. Its head is oblong-like and low on its shoulders, with an ornate sideways z-shaped black feature that forms its nose and its left brow. Its hands and feet each have three digits, with its feet and toes coming to a sharp point. It wears a light blue {{wp|Karate gi}} with a black, v-neck collar that extends down to its {{wp|Black belt (martial arts)|black belt}}. Sawk will tie this black belt to increase its power. The gi has an intricate diamond pattern on its sleeves and a black, square patch on the bend of its knees. Sawk is found secluded in the mountains where it trains to increase its strength. It becomes angered if it is interrupted while training. This Pokémon is an all male species with no female counterpart.

==Trivia==
* Sawk and {{p|Throh}} draw parallels to the [[Generation I]] Pokémon {{p|Hitmonlee}} and {{p|Hitmonchan}}, in that they are male-only {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon that appear to be related to each other.
* Sawk and its {{p|Throh|counterpart}} were designed by [[Ken Sugimori]].

===Origin===
Sawk is based on {{wp|Mas Oyama}}, a well-known {{wp|karate}} expert and the creator of {{wp|Kyokushinkai}} karate, and {{wp|Oni (folklore)|oni}}.

According to interviews with [[Ken Sugimori]] in ''Nintendo Dream'', in development, Sawk and Throh both had horns, making them look more like oni. However, they were replaced with eyebrows so as not to clash with {{p|Tornadus}} and {{p|Thundurus}}, who both were originally designed to be red and blue, like Throh and Sawk.

====Name origin====
Sawk is a corruption of ''to sock'', meaning to punch.

Dageki may be derived from 打撃 ''dageki'' (blow, strike). It may also involve 鬼 ''ki'' ({{wp|Oni (folklore)|demon}}).
