'''Latias''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラティアス''' ''Latias'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Latias''' using the [[Latiasite]].

It is a member of the [[eon duo]] of [[Hoenn]] along with {{p|Latios}}.

==Biology==
{{incomplete|2=description of Mega Latias}}
Latias is a bird-like, dragon Pokémon. It has an aerodynamic body and glass-like down feathers. The lower half of its body is red with jet-plane wings and fin-like feet. It has a blue triangular marking on its chest. It has white and red arms that can be tucked into its body. The upper-half of its body is white. It has triangular ears and a red face with a white pentagon in the middle. Latias is a female only species; {{p|Latios}} is the male counterpart.

Latias ruffles its feathers and cries loudly when there is hostility toward it. Its downy feathers can enfold its body and refract light, which allows it to become invisible or alter its appearance. It can also use its down to use its [[signature move]], {{m|Mist Ball}}. It is highly intelligent and can understand human speech. It is capable using telepathy to communicate with others. In the [[M05|fifth movie]], Latias had the ability "Sight Sharing", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. It normally does not make contact with humans or other Pokémon, and disappears when an enemy is nearby. It forms herds with several members, and is usually found {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|near water.}}

====Trophy information====
Latias appears with her counterpart, Latios.

''"Eon Pokémon. There are only female Latias and only male Latios. If they sense the presence of a human or an enemy, they will generally use the light-bending trait of their down coats to make themselves invisible. They use telepathy to speak with companions. They travel in herds, but even so, are rarely seen. They're a combination of Dragon- and Psychic-types."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Latias returns as a Poké Ball Pokémon. It uses Steel Wing to quickly fly across the stage several times to damage targets.

====Trophy information====
Latias once again shares a trophy with its counterpart.

'''NA''': ''Latias and Latios are Eon Pokémon. Both are Dragon/Psychic-type Pokémon. The red Latias is female, while the blue Latios is male. By folding in their arms, they can fly faster than fighter jets. They combine speed and teamwork when they cross paths to attack fighters with Steel Wing.''

'''PAL''': ''Latias and Latios are Eon Pokémon. Both are Dragon- and Psychic-types. The red Latias is female, while the blue Latios is male.

If red is selected, Latias roams Hoenn and Latios is found at the island. If blue is selected, Latias is found at the island and Latios roams Hoenn.

==Trivia==
* Latias shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Latios}}. They are both known as the Eon Pokémon.
[[Image:Latias Blaziken.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Pre-alpha sketch of the unused Pokémon]]
* A pre-alpha sketch depicts an [[List of unused Pokémon and character designs|unused Pokémon]] or alternative form of Latias with the traits of both a Latias and a {{p|Blaziken}}.
* Mega Latias is tied with {{p|Goodra}} for the highest base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon.
* Latias, {{p|Sandshrew|Alolan Sandshrew}}, {{p|Clefable}}, {{p|Gurdurr}}, {{p|Greninja}}, Ash-Greninja, and {{p|Minior|Minior (Meteor Form)}} are all the same weight as {{ga|Ethan}}.

===Origin===
Latias appears to be a cross between a {{wp|Jet aircraft|jet plane}} and a {{wp|dragon}}. It and {{p|Latios}} may also draw inspiration from the philosophy of {{wp|yin and yang}}. They may also be based upon the {{wp|Aeon (Gnosticism)|aeons in Gnosticism}}, being that certain aeons are immaterial beings of concepts existing in pairs of males and females emanated from God and one another; also, their category is "Eon." Latios and Latias are also based on birds, and due to Latias's {{DL|List of unused Pokémon and character designs|Blaziken / Latias|shared origin}} with {{p|Blaziken}}, they could be based on {{wp|junglefowl}}.

====Name origin====
Latias may derive from ''latere'' ({{wp|Latin}} for "to lie hidden"). ''As'' as a suffix may have been added to make it sound more feminine, opposite the more masculine-sounding ''os'' in {{p|Latios}}.
