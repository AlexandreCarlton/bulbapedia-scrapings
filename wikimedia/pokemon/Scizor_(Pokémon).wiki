'''Scizor''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ハッサム''' ''Hassam'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Scyther}} when [[trade]]d holding a [[Metal Coat]]. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Scizor''' using the [[Scizorite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Gary Scizor.png|thumb|200px|left|Scizor with its wings retracted]]
Scizor is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon with a red, metallic exoskeleton. It has gray, retractable forewings and hind wings with simple, curved venation. Its head is kite-shaped with three blunt horns extending above its forehead, and dark yellow eyes. Scizor's neck and part of its thorax give the appearance of being exposed: they show black skin, and are surrounded by its raised exoskeleton. Scizor has a large abdomen with three black, pointed stripes below the waist; the female has a larger abdomen than the male. Scizor has broad shoulders and thin, segmented arms ending in large, round pincers. Scizor's legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, its feet ending in one clawed toe in front and another in the back.

Mega Scizor's pincers lengthen and develop serrations. The lower half of the claws turns white and gain three pointed spikes on the underside. The barbs on Mega Scizor's claws can stab through concrete, and opponents caught in them are unable to escape.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Scizor</ref> Its eyespots are now blue with a thin black rim. Though they lack the black rim, its eyes are blue as well. Additional pieces of black armoring appear on various area of its body: a three-pointed crest on its forehead and striated coverings on its shoulders and thighs. Mega Scizor's legs are less detailed and resemble large, tapered spikes with white tips.

Scizor's body is as hard as steel, with claws strong enough to crush any hard object. They can be opened and closed like jaws, and are patterned with black, eyespots with yellow "pupils." It will raise its claws and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving it the appearance of having three heads. Scizor is incapable of flight, instead quickly flapping its wings to regulate its body temperature. It lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Scizor is a more dangerous version of [[Marill (Pokémon)#Super Smash Bros. Melee|Marill]]. Not only does it do more damage but it will also jump around the screen targeting an opponent.

====Trophy information====
''This evolved form of {{p|Scyther}} has arms ending in large pincers with distinctive eye-spot markings. It's unable to fly very far with its wings, but it can affect its body temperature by flapping them at high speeds. Its sleek look has made Scizor quite popular among collectors.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Scizor makes a cameo appearance in the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}}. When the stage transitions to the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Ironworks Chamber}}, it can be seen in the background along with {{p|Steelix}}, {{p|Klinklang}}, and {{p|Honedge}}.

====Trophy information====
'''NA:''' ''Is that a three-headed monster?! No, wait... the left and right heads are actually claws! Creepy. Most creatures that have face-like patterns use them defensively to give themselves a chance to flee. Scizor throws that idea away and uses them to scare foes while it attacks!''

'''PAL:''' ''It may look like this Pokémon has three heads, but that's just what it wants you to think. Look closer and you'll see that two of them are actually claws. Most creatures with face-like markings use them to scare predators to give themselves a chance to run away, but Scizor seems more likely to attack while its foe is stunned!''

Scizor is a playable character in the arcade and Nintendo Switch versions of Pokkén Tournament.

==Trivia==
* Scizor shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Kingler}}. They are both known as the Pincer Pokémon (though Scizor was known as the Scissors Pokémon in Generation II and has been called the Scissor Pokémon in the {{pkmn|anime}}).
* Despite having different base stats, Scizor and {{p|Scyther|its pre-evolution}} both have a base stat total of 500. In turn, Scizor is the only Pokémon to not have its base stat total changed upon evolving.
* Mega Scizor is tied with {{p|Pinsir|Mega Pinsir}}, {{p|Heracross|Mega Heracross}} and {{p|Genesect}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
* Scizor and {{p|Scyther}}, along with {{p|Pinsir}}, are the only Pokémon legitimately available in all 27 in-game [[Poké Ball]] variants.

===Origin===
Scizor shares characteristics with flying red {{wp|ant}}s and {{wp|mantis}}es. It also shares characteristics with wasp-mimicking {{wp|mantidflies}}.

====Name origin====
Scizor is a corruption of ''{{wp|scissors|scissor}}'' or a combination of ''scissors'' and ''{{wp|razor}}''.
