'''Genesect''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゲノセクト''' ''Genesect'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Steel}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, the [[Drive]] inserted in the cannon on its back [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Genesect|is visibly different within its sprites]] depending on the Drive it is [[Held item|holding]].
* When it is not holding any Drive, the light is orange and {{m|Techno Blast}} is {{type|Normal}}.
* When it is holding the [[Burn Drive]], the light turns red, and Techno Blast is {{type|Fire}}.
* When it is holding the [[Douse Drive]], the light turns blue and Techno Blast is {{type|Water}}.
* When it is holding the [[Shock Drive]], the light turns yellow and Techno Blast is {{type|Electric}}.
* When it is holding the [[Chill Drive]], the light turns white and Techno Blast is {{type|Ice}}.

Genesect was {{n|CoroCoro August issue reveals 'Genesect'|leaked}} in the August issue of [[CoroCoro]] magazine on July 11, 2012, and it was officially revealed on July 14, 2012.

Genesect is the last Pokémon in the original [[List of Pokémon by Unova Pokédex number|Unova Pokédex]] as well as the [[List of Pokémon by New Unova Pokédex number|New Unova Pokédex]].

==Biology==
[[File:649Genesect BW anime 3.png|150px|thumb|left|Shiny Genesect in its high-speed flight configuration]]
Genesect is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon with a metal body and a saucer-shaped head. It is primarily purple with several gray markings. It has two large red eyes and a small white part that could be either its mouth or a vent. It has thin arms with overlapping segments. Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw. There is a gray circle on each shoulder, and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward curving claw.
[[File:Genesect silk.png|thumb|250px|Genesect spinning its silk]]

The powerful cannon on its back and other enhancements were apparently added as part of the bizarre modifications made to it by [[Team Plasma]]. It is the [[Signature move|only Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Techno Blast}}, an attack which changes type depending on the [[Drive]] it holds. It is indicated that even before Team Plasma powered up Genesect, it was a skilled and ruthless hunter. By folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect can assume a flying saucer-like form, allowing it to fly. This form is known in Japanese as the 高速飛行形態 ''high-speed flight configuration''. It can also spin a sticky string from its claws to create structures.

Genesect was revived from a [[Fossil]] and technologically enhanced by [[Team Plasma]] to create the most powerful Pokémon ever. [[N]] had the project cancelled and the [[P2 Laboratory]] closed because he felt that Pokémon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, {{tc|Scientist}} Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back.

==In the anime==
[[File:Genesect anime.png|thumb|220px|Genesect in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
[[File:Genesect Army M16.png|thumb|220px|left|The Genesect Army]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Genesect Army]]====
{{an|N}} discovered an image of a Genesect on a computer monitor at the ruined [[P2 Laboratory]] in ''[[BW110|The Name's N!]]'' while he was investigating Team Plasma's plans.

The Genesect Army, a group of five Genesect led by a {{Shiny|Red}} Genesect, first appeared in ''[[BW119|Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!]]''. During his investigations, N found a destroyed building where a {{p|Patrat}} and {{p|Watchog}} were. By using his power to hear their voices, he had a flashback in which the Genesect Army were responsible for the destruction.

The Genesect Army played a major role in ''[[M16|Genesect and the Legend Awakened]]''. They went on a rampage in [[New Tork City]] while attempting to search for [[Genesect's home|their ancient habitat]], thus bringing them into conflict with a {{OBP|Mewtwo|Best Wishes series}}.

===Minor appearances===

==In the manga==
[[File:Team Plasma Genesect Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Genesect in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Genesect Army}}
The Genesect Army plays a major role in ''[[M16|Genesect and the Legend Awakened]]''. Likewise, the group appears in the {{ma|Genesect and the Legend Awakened|manga adaptation}} of the film by [[Momota Inoue]].

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
Genesect was seen as a silhouette at [[P2 Laboratory]] in ''[[PS515|The Shadow Triad]]''. The [[Shadow Triad]] was seen testing its power. It later appeared again at the {{un|Pokémon League}}, where it helped [[Colress|Hood Man]] escape. Later, in the {{chap|Black 2 & White 2}}, Colress attacked [[Aspertia City]] with it and came into contact with {{adv|Blake}} and [[Looker]], the former of whom ultimately captured Genesect. Although Blake had initially reported Genesect to the [[International Police]], in [[PS536]] he was seen in possession of it, riding it through the [[Relic Passage]].

===In the Pocket Monsters B2 W2 ~ A New Legend ~ manga===
Genesect was a Pokémon created by [[Dr. Zeno]]. After it saved Dr. Zeno from being trapped in his lab, he decided to give it to [[Arata]] in order to bring out its full potential.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Genesect (TCG)}}
==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Gensect appears as a Poké Ball summon. In the 3DS version of the game, it is unlocked after playing Endless Smash at least once. It will jump around the stage, repeatedly firing four horizontal shots followed up by a wide beam. Both shots can go through walls.
====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''A Bug/Steel-type Pokémon, Genesect was created from a 300-million-year-old fossil and later altered to carry a giant cannon on its back. The type of Drive inserted into the cannon affects the attack type of its Techno Blast. It will follow up this attack with a long-range laser.''

'''PAL''': ''A Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon revived from a 300-million-year-old fossil, then modified to carry a giant cannon on its back. The type of Drive inserted into the cannon affects the attack type of its Techno Blast. After using this attack mid-jump, it attacks its target with a long-range laser than passes through obstacles.''

==Trivia==
* Genesect is the only {{type|Bug}} [[Mythical Pokémon]].
* Genesect is tied with {{me|Pinsir}}, {{me|Scizor}}, and {{me|Heracross}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
* Genesect's backstory is similar to {{p|Mewtwo}}'s: both were created by [[villainous teams]] in at least one canon, and genetically engineered to be more powerful than the Pokémon they were based on.
* Genesect is the only Pokémon whose Pokédex entry names a villainous team, in this case, [[Team Plasma]].
* Despite {{m|Techno Blast}} being its [[signature move]], Genesect cannot receive {{STAB}} from it.
* When sent out in [[Generation VI]], Genesect unfolds from its high-speed flight configuration, the only time this configuration can be seen in the games.

===Origin===
Genesect is generally based on the giant insects of the {{wp|Paleozoic}} era, which existed for 300 million years, making it as old as the {{wp|cockroach}}. Its Steel-type features that give it a somewhat robotic appearance may be a reference to alien robots in {{wp|science fiction}} media, but this may be due to Team Plasma's modifications. Its design might also be inspired by the "artillery mech" vehicles in various {{wp|mecha anime and manga}}.

====Name origin====
Genesect may be a combination of ''{{wp|gene}}'', ''{{wp|genetics}}'', ''{{wp|genome}}'', or ''{{wp|genesis}}'', and ''{{wp|insect}}''.
