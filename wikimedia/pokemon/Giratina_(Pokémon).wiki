'''Giratina''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ギラティナ''' ''Giratina'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] to or from any other Pokémon, it has a [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Giratina|second forme]] activated by giving Giratina a [[Griseous Orb]] to hold, or while it is in its home, the [[Distortion World]]. Its original forme, '''Altered Forme''', will then become '''Origin Forme'''.

Giratina's Origin Forme was officially revealed in early February 2008.

In Origin Forme, Giratina is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Platinum}}.

Along with {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}, it is a member of the [[creation trio]] of [[Sinnoh]], representing {{wp|antimatter}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Giratina Dimension Transfer Power.png|250px|thumb|left|Giratina creating a portal to the [[Reverse World]] in the anime]]
Giratina is a large gray draconic Pokémon with gold half rings circling the back of its neck. Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along the front with red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with red tips that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if it's a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and clawed.

In its Origin Forme, it takes on a serpentine look, with six black ghostly streamers on its back with red spikes at the tips. Its legs are reduced to spikes, and four additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the three gold half-rings can grip objects. The horns on its head are now facing the back, and the black vertical stripe is broken into pieces and runs all the way down its body. It can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the [[Reverse World]], or when holding a [[Griseous Orb]].

Giratina is able to travel through and control dimensions besides those of time and space. When in its Origin Forme, it is able to pass through dimensions at will, however, it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Reverse World. It does so by emitting a whirlwind from its mouth which creates a portal. It also seems to have a connection to reflective objects, such as mirrors and pools of water. Reflections embody the concept of the Reverse World. Giratina is a highly aggressive and territorial Pokémon protective of its home. [[Sinnoh myths|Legends]] claim that Giratina appears in cemeteries and that it supposedly lives in a world on the reverse side. It was said to be banished for violence. Giratina is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] that can learn {{m|Shadow Force}}.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Giratina (movie)]]=====
{{mov|Giratina}} debuted in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. In the movie, Giratina ambushed and dragged {{mov|Dialga}} into the [[Reverse World]], in order to exact revenge against the Temporal Pokémon for causing damage to its home during its fight with {{mov|Palkia}} in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]''. [[Zero]] later attempted to copy Giratina's powers so he could conquer the Reverse World. Throughout the movie, Giratina would take on its Origin Forme whenever it is in the Reverse World, and its Altered Forme whenever it is in the real world.

Giratina reappeared in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', where it was shown for the first time with both the other members of [[Creation trio|its trio]]. It resumed its attack on Dialga, but was finally calmed down through the intervention of {{Ash}} and [[Sheena]]. It later joined forces with Dialga and Palkia to fight against {{mov|Arceus|Arceus|12}}.

=====Other=====
Giratina appeared in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'' as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Giratina and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Giratina departed for its home. It appeared in both of its formes.

====Minor appearances====
Giratina made its main series debut in ''[[DP148|Try for the Family Stone!]]'' as an illusion that was created by {{OBP|Mitchell|DP148}}'s {{p|Murkrow}}.

Giratina first appeared in the {{chap|Diamond & Pearl}}, where it used its tentacles to drag {{p|Dialga}}, {{p|Palkia}}, and [[Cyrus]] into the [[Distortion World]].

Giratina serves as the main antagonist in ''[[PS416|Double Trouble with Dialga and Palkia VI]]''. It had been chasing [[Paka and Uji]] endlessly in the Distortion World until it had taken Dialga, Palkia and Cyrus hostage. It then landed in the [[Pokémon world]] location of [[Eterna City]] and caused a rampage. Giratina concluded the rampage by targeting {{adv|Pearl}} with its signature {{m|Shadow Force}}, although {{adv|Diamond}} took the hit for him. [[Reg]] responded to its Trainer's loss by helping {{p|Rotom}} change between its Formes to attack Giratina. Giratina was forced to retreat, and [[Charon]] followed it into the Distortion World. Upon arrival, Giratina was challenged by [[Volkner]] and {{OBP|Flint|Elite Four}}, but quickly ended the resistance of their {{p|Electivire}} and {{p|Magmortar}}.

Eventually, Giratina fought Dialga, Palkia and [[Reg]] all at once inside the Distortion World. After Charon's flying craft was destroyed, he decided to retreat by commanding Giratina to fly him out of the Distortion World. However, Charon and Giratina were impeded by a {{m|Draco Meteor}} from [[Cynthia]]'s {{p|Garchomp}} as soon as they arrived back in the Pokémon world. After Charon's arrest by [[Looker]], Giratina rose again and tried to ambush {{adv|Platinum}} but Volkner's Electivire and Flint's Magmortar finished it off. Giratina was forced to return to the Distortion World on Dialga and Palkia's command.

In the {{chap|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}, Giratina was created in the [[Sinjoh Ruins]], along with Dialga and Palkia, by {{p|Arceus}}' creation process, which was forced by [[Team Rocket]]'s [[Executive (Trainer class)|Four Generals]]. Knowing that the creation process would threaten the [[Johto]] region, Team Rocket's true leader {{adv|Giovanni}} returned with [[Lance]] and [[Pryce]] to keep the creation trio at bay while {{adv|Gold}} tried to calm Arceus down.

** It is separated from the other members of its group in the Pokédex by {{p|Heatran}} and {{p|Regigigas}}.

** This sprite is also present in Pokémon Platinum's data, but is unused.
* In Pokémon Platinum, when encountered in the Distortion World the unique message "The Distortion World's Giratina appeared" is displayed. However, it is still a [[wild Pokémon]].
* In {{2v2|Black|White|2}}, in the [[The Battle Between Legendary Pokémon]], [[Fantina]] has an Origin Forme Giratina without a Griseous Orb.
* Altered Forme Giratina is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] Ghost-type Pokémon.
** Origin Forme Giratina is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{Type|Ghost}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Giratina may be based on the biblical figure of {{wp|Devil|the Devil}}, as its Pokédex entry claims it was banished to the Distortion World for its violence, which may be reminiscent of how the Devil was once an angel who was banished to {{wp|Hell}} for attempting a revolution.  Furthering this are the possibilities that Giratina's Altered Forme is based on a {{wp|basilisk}}, and its Origin Forme based on a {{wp|snake|serpent}}, two creatures that the Devil would often take the form of in the {{wp|Bible}}.

Giratina may also be based on Seta, a giant centipede, from the Japanese fairytale, "{{wp|My Lord Bag of Rice}}", which was said to prey on dragon hatchlings and be as large as a mountain.

In its Altered Forme, Giratina's wings may be based on a bat's, and its body has an insect-like, six-legged feature, but its posture is similar to a {{wp|sauropod}}.

Its Origin Forme has a body similar to a serpent, while the six protrusions on its body may be based on a {{wp|scorpion}}'s stinger or {{wp|spider}} legs. This Forme also shares physical traits with the {{wp|Amphiptere}}, a {{wp|European dragon}}-like creature with wings but no legs.

In interviews [[Junichi Masuda]] and Takeshi Kawachimaru did with {{wp|G4 (TV channel)|G4}}, they said that Giratina and the Distortion World were created to be personifications of {{wp|antimatter}}.<ref>[http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/694081/junichi-masuda-takeshi-kawachimaru-talk-pokemon-platinum-particle-physics-bridges-and-more/ Junichi Masuda & Takeshi Kawachimaru Talk 'Pokemon Platinum', Particle Physics, Bridges, And More! - G4tv.com]</ref> In HeartGold and SoulSilver, [[Cynthia]] also states this.

====Name origin====
Giratina may be a combination of ''{{wp|girasol}}'' (a type of red {{wp|opal}}), ''{{wp|guillotine}}'', or ''girare'' (Italian for ''to wander around''); and プラチナ ''purachina'' (Japanese for {{wp|platinum}}).
