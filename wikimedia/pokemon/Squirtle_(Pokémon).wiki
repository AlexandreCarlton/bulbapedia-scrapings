'''Squirtle''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゼニガメ''' ''Zenigame'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Wartortle}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Blastoise}} starting at [[level]] 36.

Along with {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Charmander}}, Squirtle is one of three [[starter Pokémon]] of [[Kanto]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].

==Biology==
[[File:May Squirtle Withdraw.png|thumb|150px|left|Squirtle in its shell]]
Squirtle is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. It has large eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.

Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or [[EP060|for sleeping]], and its grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance when this Pokémon swims. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. In the past, {{m|Skull Bash}} was its signature move. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's Edge Pokémon|around small ponds and lakes.}} [[EP060|The anime has shown]] that it can be found living on secluded islands with other members of its evolutionary line.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Gary's Squirtle]]=====
Squirtle was mentioned in the first episode of the anime, ''[[EP001|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]'', as one of the three [[starter Pokémon]] new Trainers in [[Pallet Town]] can choose from. Ash dreamed of owning one, and it was his first choice for his starter Pokémon. However, when he arrived at {{an|Professor Oak|Oak}}'s lab, he realized it was too late, as another Trainer who started the same day had already taken it. It was shown battling and defeating [[Samurai]]'s {{p|Metapod}}.

It wasn't until ''[[EP269|The Ties that Bind]]'' that it was revealed that the Trainer who took Squirtle was none other than [[Gary Oak]], Ash's [[rival]]. By then, it had already evolved into a {{TP|Gary|Blastoise}}.

=====[[Ash's Squirtle]]=====
The first real Squirtle appeared in ''[[EP012|Here Comes the Squirtle Squad]]''. The [[Squirtle Squad]] were a gang of rogue Squirtle who were deserted by their Trainers. Ash befriended and captured [[Ash's Squirtle|their leader]], while the rest of them became a firefighting group. Squirtle stayed with Ash until ''[[EP147|The Fire-ring Squad!]]'', when it returned to the Squirtle Squad.

{{an|May}} received her own Squirtle from {{an|Professor Oak}} in ''[[AG133|The Right Place and the Right Mime]]''. May's Squirtle was very young and timid but was used in several contests.

=====[[Team Go-Getters]]=====
The main character in ''[[SS019|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters out of the Gate!]]'' special is a Squirtle that claims that he used to be human. He joins Team Go-Getters in their rescue work. While he can't use {{m|Water Gun}}, he is happy to use {{m|Bubble}} because it looks pretty.

=====[[Tierno's Squirtle]]=====
A Squirtle appeared in ''[[XY039|Summer of Discovery!]]'', under the ownership of {{an|Tierno}}. Tierno's Squirtle had evolved into Wartortle by the time off ''[[XY065|Good Friends, Great Training!]]'' and then into Blastoise by ''[[XY091|Tag Team Battle Inspiration!]]''

=====Other=====
Multiple wild Squirtle appeared in ''[[EP060|Beach Blank-Out Blastoise]]''.

In ''[[SS014|Journey to the Starting Line!]]'', a set of the three [[Kanto]] starter Pokémon in which a boy named {{OBP|Gilbert|SS014}} was supposed to choose from as his starting Pokémon were scared off by [[Ash's Tauros]]. {{an|Professor Oak}}, {{Tracey}}, {{Delia}}, and Gilbert had to split up and find the three missing Pokémon. Squirtle was the second one found. The Tiny Turtle Pokémon was stuck in a tree that was hanging over a cliff. [[Ash's Bulbasaur]] managed to catch the Squirtle before it could fall off the cliff.

Another Squirtle was seen with Professor Oak in ''[[AG071|A Six Pack Attack!]]'' along with a {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Charmander}}. Professor Oak showed off yet another Squirtle along with a Bulbasaur and Charmander during the [[Kanto Fair]].

{{main|Blasty}}
{{adv|Green}} stole a Squirtle from {{adv|Professor Oak}}, which she nicknamed Blasty. He has since evolved into {{p|Wartortle}} and then {{p|Blastoise}} more quickly than the others, possibly due to her innate talent in evolving Pokémon, as acknowledged by the [[Masked Man]]. Blasty is never shown in his Squirtle form, (save the contents page of the [[Pokémon Adventures volume 3|third volume]] and a picture Professor Oak had of Green stealing him from his lab). His first appearance, as a Wartortle, is in ''[[PS015|Wartortle Wars]]'', returning as a Blastoise in ''[[PS030|Zap, Zap, Zapdos]].''

==Other appearances==
[[File:SSBB Waterfall.png|200px|right|thumb|{{ga|Red|Pokémon Trainer}} commanding Squirtle to use {{m|Waterfall}} in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
{{sbw|Squirtle}} is seen on the stage Pokéfloats and is the first Pokéfloat to appear. Play begins on its head and arms until it slowly leaves off the bottom of the screen. After traveling through all the Pokéfloats, the screen will be empty for a few seconds before Squirtle pops up and the cycle begins again.

====Trophy information====
''Retreating into its shell and spitting water at its foes is Squirtle's trademark response to danger. It's one of the three Pokémon that Trainers can receive from Professor Oak in Pokémon Red and Blue. Squirtle evolves into Wartortle and then Blastoise, ramping up its water powers with each evolution.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
{{sbw|Squirtle (SSBB)|Squirtle}} is a playable Pokémon used by the {{SSB|Pokémon Trainer}}. It can use {{m|Waterfall}} to recover from falls as well as {{m|Withdraw}}, in which case it retreats to its shell and shoots water from the back of it propelling him forwards. It also uses {{m|Water Gun}} to push enemies with a stream of water. Squirtle is a lightweight and uses various attacks using its shell and {{type|Water}} moves to combat its foes. It uses {{m|Hydro Pump}} in the Pokémon Trainer's Final Smash, {{DL|Final Smash|Triple Finish}}.

{{SmashMoves|type=Water|game=Brawl|Spe=Water Gun|SpeM=yes|SpeS=Withdraw|SpeSM=yes|SpeU=Waterfall|SpeUM=yes|SpeD=Pokémon Change|FS=Triple Finish|FS2=Hydro Pump}}

====Trophy Information====
''"A Tiny Turtle Pokémon. In times of danger, it pulls its arms and legs inside its shell to protect from enemy attacks. When it conceals its neck, it also shoots a powerful stream of water from its mouth. Its shell not only protects its body, but also reduces water friction when in the water. When leveled up, it evolves into Wartortle."''
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Squirtle returns as a trophy in both versions of the game.
====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''At the start of their Pokémon adventures, many aspiring trainers visit Professor Oak to choose one of three starter Pokémon. Squirtle's always a popular choice, what with it being so gosh-darn adorable. When it's in danger, though, it withdraws into its shell and spits a high-pressure burst of water—a bit less adorable.''

'''PAL''': ''At the start of their Pokémon adventures, many aspiring trainers visit Professor Oak to choose one of three starter Pokémon. Squirtle's always a popular choice, what with him being so flipping adorable. When it's in danger, though, it withdraws into its shell and spits a high-pressure burst of water, which isn't quite so adorable.''

==Trivia==
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokemon.png|thumb|250px|right|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Squirtle as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Squirtle on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.
* As a species, Squirtle has been trained most frequently of all the [[Kanto]] [[starter Pokémon]] by major anime Trainers, with {{Ash}}, {{an|May}}, {{Gary}}, and {{an|Tierno}} each owning one.

===Origin===
Squirtle appears to be based on {{wp|turtle}}s.

====Name origin====
Squirtle is a combination of ''squirt'' (''to spray'' and ''small child'') and ''turtle'', for its turtle-like appearance.

Zenigame is the Japanese word 銭亀 (baby pond turtle). According to {{game|Black and White|s}}'s television program ''PokéQuiz'', "'Zeni' is an old-fashioned word for money. Squirtle's shells look like old coins, so that's how they got their name!"
