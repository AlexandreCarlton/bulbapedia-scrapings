'''Eevee''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イーブイ''' ''Eievui'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into one of [[Eeveelution|eight different Pokémon]] through various methods:
* {{p|Vaporeon}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]].
* {{p|Jolteon}} when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].
* {{p|Flareon}} when exposed to a [[Fire Stone]].
* {{p|Espeon}} when leveled up with high [[friendship]] during the [[time|daytime]], including [[time|morning]] ([[Generation II]] onward, excludes areas with a [[Moss Rock]] or [[Ice Rock]]), or when leveled up with high friendship with a [[Sun and Moon Shards|Sun Shard]] in the [[Bag]] ({{Pokémon XD}}).
* {{p|Umbreon}} when leveled up with high [[friendship]] during the [[time|nighttime]] ([[Generation II]] onward, excludes areas with a [[Moss Rock]] or [[Ice Rock]]), or when leveled up with high friendship with a [[Sun and Moon Shards|Moon Shard]] in the [[Bag]] ({{Pokémon XD}}).
* {{p|Leafeon}} when leveled up near a [[Moss Rock]] ([[Generation IV]] onward).
* {{p|Glaceon}} when leveled up near an [[Ice Rock]] ([[Generation IV]] onward).
* {{p|Sylveon}} when leveled up with a {{type|Fairy}} move and two levels of [[Affection]] ([[Generation VI]] onward, excludes areas with a [[Moss Rock]] or [[Ice Rock]]).

Eevee is the [[starter Pokémon]] for the main characters of [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]] and [[Pokémon Conquest]]. It is also the [[rival]]'s starter Pokémon in {{game|Yellow}}, although [[Professor Oak]] originally intended to give it to the {{player}}.

==Biology==
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped creature with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears, and a small black nose. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, and is mostly only found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|cities and towns}}. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that allows it to adapt to many different kinds of environments. Eventually, Eevee may evolve to better suit its surroundings. According to [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]], Eevee has a naive personality.

Eevee is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the exclusive [[Z-Move]] {{m|Extreme Evoboost}}.

=====Other=====
Eevee debuted in ''[[EP040|The Battling Eevee Brothers]]''.

===In Pokémon Origins===
[[File:Professor Oak Eevee PO.png|thumb|250px|Eevee in [[Pokémon Origins]]]]
An Eevee appeared in ''[[PO01|File 1: Red]]'' with [[Professor Oak]].

==In the manga==
[[File:Y Veevee Eevee.png|thumb|200px|Eevee in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Electric Tale of Pikachu manga===
Like in the {{pkmn|anime}}, [[Mikey]] owns an Eevee in the [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] manga. Mikey and his Eevee appear in the chapter ''[[ET06|To Evolve or Not to Evolve, That is the Question!]]''.

===In the Magical Pokémon Journey manga===
{{main|Coconut's Eevee}}
{{main|Lu}}
An Eevee is owned by [[Coconut]] in [[Magical Pokémon Journey]]. This Eevee is a smart Pokémon who is very loyal to Coconut.

Later in the series, another Eevee named [[Lu]] appears. Coconut's Eevee falls in love with Lu, who confesses her own love to Eevee before moving away.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Vee}}
In ''[[PS019|Blame it on Eevee]]'' an Eevee is seen as a Pokémon experimented on by [[Team Rocket]], in their tests to attempt merging {{p|Articuno}}, {{p|Zapdos}}, and {{p|Moltres}} into {{DL|Legendary birds (Adventures)|Thu-Fi-Zer|a single Pokémon}}. The experiments gave Eevee the characteristic of being able to mutate into three of his evolved forms, namely {{p|Vaporeon}}, {{p|Jolteon}}, and {{p|Flareon}} and revert, though he still requires the energies of an [[evolutionary stone]]. {{adv|Red}} eventually captures this Eevee as a prerequisite for challenging [[Erika]] and gave him the name Vee. When he evolved into Espeon, however, he lost his mutation ability and became unable to revert to his base form.

Yellow fantasized about Pokémon that could evolve via [[Evolutionary stone|stone]] in ''[[PS058|The Kindest Tentacruel]]'' which an Eevee was one of them.

Another Eevee was seen under the ownership of [[Karen]] in ''[[PS268|The Escape]]'', during her childhood as one of the children captured by the [[Masked Man]]. It is presumed that this Eevee eventually evolves into her {{p|Umbreon}}, which she used to fight {{adv|Green}}.

{{adv|Y}} caught an Eevee, which she named Veevee. When she used her in a battle against [[Team Flare]], she evolved into a {{p|Sylveon}}.

===In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure! manga===

==In the TCG==
{{main|Eevee (TCG)}}

As in the games and anime, Eevee is notable in the TCG for being able to evolve into the most differently-named Pokémon cards, with its eight normal evolutions, as well as {{TCG|Dark Pokémon|Dark forms}} of the Generation I evolutions and Espeon, and {{TCG|Light Pokémon|Light forms}} of the Generation I evolutions.

==In the TFG==
One Eevee figure has been released.

==Other appearances==
[[File:Eevee SSB4.png|220px|thumb|Eevee in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Eevee only appears as a random trophy.

====Trophy information====
''As adaptable a Pokémon as any yet discovered, Eevee's evolutionary progress changes to meet the conditions of its environment. So far, five evolutionary forms have been discovered and then catalogued for this unique Pokémon; Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, and Umbreon. All evolutions have special benefits.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Eevee appears as a [[Poké Ball]] Pokémon. It uses {{m|Take Down}} to hit opponents.
====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Normal-type Pokémon is as adaptable to evolution as they come, with eight evolutions discovered thus far. If you pair that potential with its adorable features, it's no wonder Eevee is so popular! In Smash Bros., Eevee will attack a nearby opponent with Take Down. Sadly, this attack isn't incredibly powerful. ''

'''PAL''': ''This adorable Normal-type Pokémon's ability to evolve in so many different ways makes it a popular choice with trainers. When brought out in battle, Eevee uses Take Down on the first opponent it sees, but...it's not very effective. Never mind. Eevee may not be the toughest Pokémon, but it'll always be one of the cutest. ''

In [[Pokémon GO]], Eevee normally evolves at random into one of {{p|Vaporeon}}, {{p|Jolteon}}, or {{p|Flareon}}. However, if it is the current [[Buddy Pokémon]] and has collected at least 2 [[Candy]], it will evolve into {{p|Espeon}} (during day mode) or {{p|Umbreon}} (during night mode). If Eevee has a particular [[nickname]], then once per nickname it is guaranteed to evolve into a particular Pokémon (regardless of other conditions).
*Rainer: Vaporeon
*Sparky: Jolteon
*Pyro: Flareon
*Sakura: Espeon

==Trivia==
* Eevee's name is a {{wp|palindrome}}.
* Eevee was designed by [[Motofumi Fujiwara]].<ref>https://twitter.com/atsuko_nishida/status/783643367523557376</ref>
* Eevee bears many distinguishing characteristics because of its [[Eeveelution|evolved forms]]:
** Eevee is the only Pokémon to not share any types with any of its evolutions.
** Eevee has the most evolutions of any Pokémon and is the only Pokémon which has more than three evolutions.
** The fan-made term to describe the evolutions of Eevee, [[Eeveelution]]s, was made official after its use in the strategy guide for [[Pokémon Stadium 2]], followed by {{TCG|Eeveelution|a TCG Theme Deck}}.
* In early English promotional material for [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue]], Eevee was called "Eon", the suffix of all the evolutions of Eevee.
* In [[Generation I]], Eevee is the only Pokémon to have a branched evolution.
* It is impossible for Eevee to evolve into Espeon and Umbreon in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} because the games lack a {{DL|Time|Generation III|time system}}. It is also impossible for it to evolve into Leafeon and Glaceon in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} since neither Johto nor Kanto has a [[Moss Rock]] or an [[Ice Rock]].
* Despite Eevee being obtainable before the [[Pokémon League]] in [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2]], it cannot evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon until after the Elite Four are defeated. This is because [[Twist Mountain]] and [[Pinwheel Forest]] are inaccessible before then.
* Eevee is the only pre-existing Pokémon to [[List of Pokémon with cross-generational evolutions|receive an evolution]] in [[Generation VI]], though many received [[Mega Evolution]]s.
* Four of Eevee's evolutions evolve through abnormal means in the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series]] ({{p|Espeon}}, {{p|Umbreon}}, {{p|Leafeon}}, and {{p|Glaceon}}).
** In the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series, Eevee evolves using the {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Sun Ribbon}}, or {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Lunar Ribbon}} with at least 1 star of IQ, a {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Mossy Rock}}, or a {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Frozen Rock}} into its respective evolutions.
* In {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}}, all of Eevee's evolutions up to the third generation can be captured; however, Eevee cannot even be found at all. This was changed in [[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]].
* Despite the fact that {{an|May}}, {{Gary}} and [[Sakura]] each owned an Eevee that went on to evolve, Eevee was never seen evolving on screen in the anime until ''[[DP174|Last Call — First Round!]]'' when [[Ursula]] evolved her two Eevee into {{p|Flareon}} and {{p|Vaporeon}} during a Contest appeal, over thirteen years into the series.

===Origin===
Eevee shares traits with {{wp|fox}}es, more specifically the {{wp|fennec fox}}, {{wp|dog}}s and {{wp|cat}}s.
====Name origin====
Eevee and Eievui are the pronunciations of ''E-V'', the first two letters in the word [[evolution]].
