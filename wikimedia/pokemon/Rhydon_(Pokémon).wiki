'''Rhydon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サイドン''' ''Sidon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ground|Rock}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rhyhorn}} starting at [[level]] 42 and evolves into {{p|Rhyperior}} when [[trade]]d holding a [[Protector]].

==Biology==
[[File:Scientist Rhydon Surf.png|thumb|left|200px|Rhydon {{m|surf}}ing]]
Rhydon is a large, gray, bipedal Pokémon with features of both dinosaurs and rhinoceroses. It has a cream-colored, drill-like horn on its snout, the female having a smaller horn than the male. There are other protrusions on the head as well, including a spike curving forward from the middle of its head, two triangular, points resembling ears to the sides, a wide, wavy crest under the ears, and spiky ridges on its cheeks. It has red eyes and two fangs protruding from its upper jaw. It has a cream-colored stomach and a row of spikes down its back. Rhydon has a long tail with skinny, black stripes.

Rhydon is a physically powerful Pokémon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn is able to bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds. Rhydon is protected from heat and physical blows by its armor-like hide. It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Rhydon has a well-developed brain, but can also be forgetful. It lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|rough terrain}}.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===
[[File:Team Rocket Rhydon.png|thumb|left|250px|Rhydon in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====
A Rhydon appeared in ''[[EP058|Riddle Me This]]'', being one of [[Blaine]]'s Pokémon. Blaine used Rhydon against {{Ash}} during the first battle for Ash's {{badge|Volcano}}. It briefly battled {{AP|Charizard}} who then refused to battle. While normally tough against {{t|Electric}} attacks, Rhydon was defeated when {{AP|Pikachu}} struck Rhydon's horn, which acted like a lightning rod. It reappeared in flashbacks in ''[[EP059|Volcanic Panic]]'' and ''[[EP073|Bad to the Bone]]''.

{{an|Giovanni}} owns a Rhydon that he loaned to [[Jessie]] and [[James]] in ''[[EP063|The Battle of the Badge]]'', where it was used to battle Ash. It was defeated by {{AP|Pidgeotto}} and then Pikachu.

[[Giant Pokémon|Giant]] Rhydon were seen on [[Fairchild Island]] in ''[[EP104|Bound For Trouble]]''.

We're It...!]]''. Rhydon had {{a|Lightning Rod}}, which left Pikachu's Electric [[Move|attacks]] useless, but Pikachu was able to defeat Rhydon with {{m|Iron Tail}}.

In ''[[DP057|Bibarel Gnaws Best!]]'', the [[head engineer]] owned a Rhydon. It was used in order to drill out rocks for the bridge, but the Drill Pokémon was quickly attacked and defeated by {{p|Bibarel}}. When Bibarel was cornered, Ash's Pikachu used Iron Tail to finish Rhydon for good.

A Rhydon appeared in ''[[BW096|Meloetta and the Undersea Temple!]]'', under the ownership of a {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}. It was used alongside a {{p|Golem}} to capture {{an|Meloetta}}.

[[File:Giovanni Rhydon PO.png|thumb|left|220px|Rhydon in [[Pokémon Origins]]]]
[[File:Blue Rhydon PG.png|thumb|220px|Rhydon in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]

He used it during his [[Indigo Plateau|Pokémon League]] battle against [[Agatha]], where it was seen taking on her {{p|Arbok}} and {{TP|Agatha|Gengar}}. It managed to defeat Arbok, but it is unclear if it won against Gengar as well, for the outcome of that battle was never shown onscreen. Whatever the case, Blue eventually managed to defeat Agatha, allowing him to progress to [[Lance]]'s room.

Two Rhydon appeared during a flashback in ''[[PG18|The Redemption]]'', where they were seen petrified after the [[ultimate weapon]] was used by [[AZ]] to end the great war of [[Kalos]], 3,000 years previously.

==In the manga==
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{Main|Blue's Rhydon}}
[[File:Koga Rhydon Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Rhydon in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
Rhydon debuts in ''[[PS007|Raging Rhydon]]'', as [[Koga]]'s Pokémon that is forced to evolve by its Trainer with a mysterious injection, being the first evolution shown in the manga due to {{adv|Red}}'s [[Poli]]whirl and [[Blue's Charmander]] evolving off-screen at the time.

Later in ''[[PS016|Tauros the Tyrant]]'', a Team Rocket Grunt used a Rhydon in an attempt to catch {{adv|Green}}.

In ''[[PS018|A Tale of Ninetales]]'', a wild Rhydon attacked two of {{adv|Blue}}'s fan girls.

Rhydon is later seen as one of {{adv|Giovanni}}'s Pokémon in ''[[PS038|Long Live the Nidoqueen!?]]'', where he used Fissure to trap Red.

In ''[[PS106|How Do You Do, Sudowoodo?]]'' {{adv|Gold}} encounters a wild Rhydon during his race with [[Whitney]]. The Rhydon in question was hunting down a {{p|Sudowoodo}} hiding from it, and kidnapped Whitney when she interfered with her {{p|Miltank}}, breaking her arm in the process. Gold tells Sudowoodo to stand up for itself and, with assistance from his billiard cue, helps Sudowoodo defeat the Rhydon with a strong punch to the gut.

In ''[[PS116|Rock, Paper...Scizor]]'', {{adv|Blue}} captures a Rhydon outside the [[Viridian Gym]]. He uses him to defeat [[Chuck]] in ''[[PS162|Heckled by Hitmontop]]'', as well as [[Orm]] in ''[[PS279|Don't Doubt Deoxys]]''. Near the end of the FireRed and LeafGreen saga, Blue remarks on a footnote Giovanni included in his handbook: Rhydon possibly possessed a stronger form. This is a reference to Rhydon's new evolution, {{p|Rhyperior}}, an evolution that succeeded in occurring thanks to {{adv|Silver}}'s knowledge of Pokémon trading, resulting in the same Rhydon, as Rhyperior, being on hand with him until being returned to Blue later on.

A Trainer's Rhydon appeared in ''[[PS418|Deprogramming Porygon-Z]]'' and ''[[PS421|Clobbering Claydol]]''.

Multiple Rhydon appeared in ''[[PS484|All About Arceus III]]''.

===In the Pokémon Zensho manga===
Giovanni's Rhydon was {{Zensho|Satoshi}}'s opponent for his final Gym battle. It went up against [[Satoshi's Charizard (Zensho)|his Charizard]] and was defeated.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
{{OBP|Giovanni|Pocket Monsters}}'s Rhydon was used in the Gym battle against {{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} in ''[[PM031|Get The Last Badge!!]]''.

===In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga===
Gary has a Rhydon which was sent out with his other Pokémon to battle the giant Slowpoke in ''[[ET19|Ash vs. Gary]]''.

==Trivia==
[[File:Early Rhydon.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Capsule Monsters|Early sketches]] of Rhydon]]
* [http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/gfreak/page02.html According to interviews with Ken Sugimori] ([http://www.glitterberri.com/pokemon-red-blue/game-freak-staff-interview/creating-the-pokemon/ translation]), Rhydon was the first Pokémon ever created. This is further supported as its [[list of Pokémon by index number (Generation I)|index number]] is 001 in [[Generation I]], as well as early sketches from [[Capsule Monsters]] featuring Rhydon.
* [[Ash's Pikachu]] fought [[Blaine]]'s Rhydon in the [[Anime physics|anime and defeated it]], despite it being a {{type|Ground}} immune to {{t|Electric}} attacks. Rhydon's horn also serves as a {{a|Lightning Rod|lightning rod}} which negates electric attacks as of the rules for the Pokémon effect. Since then, that battle has been brought up frequently in comparisons between the games and anime and has spawned the popular (albeit misquoted) Pokémon Internet meme, "Pikachu! Aim for the horn!"
* Since Rhydon's [[index number]] is 001 [[list of Pokémon by index number (Generation I)|in Generation I]], a [[glitch Pokémon]] with an index number of 000 or that is greater than 152 will [[Rhydon glitch|revert to Rhydon]] when its Pokédex entry is viewed.
* Rhydon and its {{p|Rhyperior|evolution}} share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Nidoqueen}} and {{p|Nidoking}}. They are all known as the Drill Pokémon.

===Origin===
It appears to draw much of its inspiration from a {{wp|rhinoceros}} and some aspects of various dinosaurs, such as {{wp|ceratopsids}}.

====Name origin====
Rhydon may be a combination of ''{{wp|rhinoceros}}'' and ''don''. ''Rhy'' may also derive from the {{wp|igneous rock}} called ''{{wp|rhyolite}}'', alluding to Rhydon's Ground/Rock type combination. ''Don'', from the Latin ''dominus'', may emphasize Rhydon's being the final evolution of its line (pre-[[Generation IV]]), as it is a title akin to ''lord'' in several {{wp|Romance languages}}; ''-odon'', ultimately from ''ὀδούς'', the ancient Greek word for ''tooth'', is a suffix commonly used in {{wp|dinosaur}} names, and so Rhydon's name could be a reference to those prehistoric creatures as well.

Sidon is a combination of 犀 ''sai'' (rhinoceros) and ''don''.
