'''Kyurem''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''キュレム''' ''Kyurem'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Ice}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon, it has [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Kyurem|two other forms]], which are activated by using the [[DNA Splicers]] on it and either {{p|Reshiram}} or {{p|Zekrom}}, resulting in a process called '''Absofusion''' that removes Reshiram or Zekrom from the party until the fusion is undone. It will then become '''White Kyurem''' (with Reshiram) or '''Black Kyurem''' (with Zekrom). However, it is impossible to own a White Kyurem and a Black Kyurem at the same time legitimately, as the game rejects the second fusion of Kyurem with Reshiram/Zekrom, and Kyurem cannot be [[Trade|traded]] or placed in [[Pokemon Bank]] while fused.

Along with Reshiram and Zekrom, Kyurem is a member of the [[Tao trio]], which exists in the legends of the [[Unova]] region.

As both Black Kyurem and White Kyurem, it is the [[game mascot]] of [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2|Pokémon Black 2 and White 2]], respectively.

==Biology==
Kyurem is a gray and blue, bipedal Pokémon of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. Kyurem has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, has a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head and a yellow crest on its skull. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms and tail. It has two arms, each with its own claw and each arm is jointed together from its oddly shaped blue wings, which are believed to be used for flying and storing cold air. Each wing has two spikes of ice. The ice covering the wings can break, revealing gray tendril-like appendages on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head<!--visible in its Dream World art and [[Pokédex 3D]]--> also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender, and has three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.

Kyurem has two alternate forms, '''White Kyurem''' and '''Black Kyurem''', which are formed by combining with {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}}, respectively, and share many aspects of their designs with them. It can use Absofusion on their respective [[Dragon Stones]] to change to White or Black Kyurem. When transformed into either, its legs are just like before, but shorter and the middle toe becomes ice. As White Kyurem, it has some extra icy details on the legs. Its tail resembles that of Reshiram or Zekrom, but they are attached to the body with three gray parts of skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains four holes: they are horizontal on White Kyurem and vertical on Black Kyurem. The torsos of each form are similar, but White Kyurem's torso is more slim than Black Kyurem's bulky torso. Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each which can come out and 'plug in' the aforementioned holes. As White Kyurem, it has thin arms with two rings and three claws each, wings between the rings on its forearms, and its right arm and wing are frozen. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but more muscular and without wings, and its left arm and wing are frozen. Its neck is the same shape, but becomes upright; White Kyurem uses Reshiram's fur and Black Kyurem uses Zekrom's skin. In both forms, the ice covering one of Kyurem's jaws (upper for White Kyurem, lower for Black Kyurem) has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth. During battle, Black Kyurem and White Kyurem enter [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem|Overdrive mode]] and tubes sprout from its back to its tail. In White Kyurem's case, the ends of its hair and wings become fiery and its tail acquires fiery highlights. In Black Kyurem's case, parts of its right arm and the tip of the horn on the back of its head turn blue, while its tail lights up with electricity. In ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', Kyurem can also change into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem without fusing by channeling the power of powers of both Reshiram and Zekrom it has within itself.

Kyurem generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. Due to an old legend, it may be assumed Kyurem may be hostile towards Pokémon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly ate them if they were found outside at night. It is said to be an [[extraterrestrial Pokémon]] according to folklore. Kyurem is the [[Signature move|only Pokémon]] that can learn {{m|Glaciate}}, while its alternate forms White Kyurem and Black Kyurem can respectively learn {{m|Ice Burn}} and {{m|Freeze Shock}} instead. White Kyurem and Black Kyurem can also learn Reshiram's and Zekrom's signature moves {{m|Fusion Flare}} and {{m|Fusion Bolt}}, respectively.

Kyurem, in all of its forms, made its debut as one of the stars of ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', along with [[Swords of Justice (M15)|Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion]] and {{OBP|Keldeo|M15}}. Kyurem was challenged by {{p|Keldeo}}, who wasn't ready to fight Kyurem, but arrogantly claimed that he was a Sword of Justice. After the terrified Keldeo fled during the middle of the fight, Kyurem relentlessly pursues Keldeo in order to finish the battle they had started. Along with the other Legendary Pokémon present in the movie, Kyurem can [[Talking Pokémon|speak through telepathy]].

=====Other=====
Kyurem appeared in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'' as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Kyurem and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Kyurem departed for its home. It appeared in all three of its forms.

Kyurem reappeared in ''[[PG15|The King Returns]]'', this time under the control of [[Ghetsis]]. It was used as part of his final attempt to freeze Unova, but was challenged by [[N]] and his {{p|Reshiram}}. However, Ghetsis used the DNA Splicers to fuse the two Pokémon into White Kyurem. It was last seen being challenged by [[Hilbert]] and his {{p|Zekrom}}.

===Origin===
Kyurem and its two counterparts {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}} are based on the concept of {{wp|yin and yang}} in {{wp|Taoism}}. Kyurem, however, symbolizes {{wp|Wuji (philosophy)|wuji}}, the absence of yin and yang. In regards to overall design, it appears to be based on a {{wp|theropod}} and a {{wp|European dragon}}, similar to Zekrom. Its arms in particular seem to be influenced by ''{{wp|Tyrannosaurus rex}}''. Kyurem's type, {{t|Ice}}, may allude to the absence of energy and the concept of {{wp|absolute zero}}. Kyurem's rock-like body and its origin story of arriving on Earth like a meteor are references to comets, which are largely composed of ice crystals.

Given that its Japanese name contains mu, it may be based on the {{wp|koan}} {{wp|Mu (negative)|mu}}.

====Name origin====
Kyurem may be a combination of 冷 ''rei'' (cold), 急冷 ''kyuurei'' (rapid cooling), or 雪 ''yuki'' (snow) with the {{wp|kana}} reversed, and 無 ''{{wp|Mu (negative)|mu}}'' (nothing). It may also derive from 零 ''rei'' (zero). ''Rem'' may also mimic the ''rom'' of {{p|Zekrom}} and the ''ram'' of {{p|Reshiram}}.
