'''Scyther''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ストライク''' ''Strike'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Scizor}} when [[trade]]d holding a [[Metal Coat]].

==Biology==
Scyther is a bipedal, insectoid creature. It is primarily green with cream accents between its three body segments. On the back of its somewhat reptilian head are three points, and it has narrow eyes. Its forearms consist of large, white scythes, which it uses for hunting as well as fighting. On its thighs are spikes of fur, and it has three clawed toes on its large feet. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it is rarely seen doing so. The abdomen of a female will be slightly larger than that of the male.

Scyther's blade-like forearms are capable of slicing through logs, and become sharper by cutting through hard materials. Using swift movements, it camouflages itself and enhances the effectiveness of its scythes. [[EP097|The anime]] has shown that wild Scyther form groups. If a challenger Scyther wins a battle against the leader of the Scyther swarm, the original Scyther leader will depart and the challenger will take place as the new leader. [[EP042|It has also been shown]] that Scyther despises the color red, and becomes aggressive when confronted with this color. Although it is rare, Scyther can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands.}}

==In the anime==
===In the main series===
[[File:Scyther anime.png|220px|thumb|Scyther in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Tracey's Scyther]]=====
{{Tracey}} {{pkmn2|caught}} an elderly Scyther in ''[[EP097|Tracey Gets Bugged]]''. Even in its old age, it is very aggressive, but for the same reasons, Tracey tries not to use it.

=====[[Bugsy's Scyther]]=====
[[Bugsy]] used a Scyther against {{Ash}} in ''[[EP144|Gettin' The Bugs Out]]''. This Scyther was trained to block {{Type|Fire}} attacks by using {{m|Swords Dance}} as a fan. Ash discovered that this defensive strategy doesn't work if a Fire-type move is used from above, which allowed his {{AP|Cyndaquil}} to win in his Gym match.

=====Other=====
Scyther debuted in ''[[EP042|Showdown at Dark City]]'', under the ownership of [[Yas]]. It was one of the Pokémon used during the feuds between the {{DL|Gym|Kas Gym|Kas}} and {{DL|Gym|Yas Gym}}s of [[Dark City]]. It is the Yas Gym's primary Pokémon.

In ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'', a Scyther owned by [[Corey]] was one of the Pokémon that was captured and cloned by {{OBP|Mewtwo|original series}}. When {{TRT}} saw this Pokémon being cloned, it was mistaken for an {{p|Alakazam}}. The Scyther clone reappeared in ''[[Mewtwo Returns]]''.

A Scyther appeared during the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]] in ''[[EP077|The Fourth Round Rumble]]'', under the ownership of [[Jeanette Fisher]].

A Scyther was used by the [[Gym Leader]] of [[Navel Island]], [[Danny]], in ''[[EP093|Navel Maneuvers]]''.

It reappeared in flashbacks in ''[[EP098|A Way Off Day Off]]'' and ''[[EP111|Hello, Pummelo!]]''.

In ''[[SS020|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time & Darkness]]'', Scyther was a member of Team Razor Wind, along with {{p|Sandslash}} and {{p|Zangoose}}. The trio of clawed Pokémon were first seen being blasted out of the [[Wigglytuff's Guild|Wigglytuff Guild]]. Team Razor Wind overheard that [[Team Poképals]] were assigned with the task of traveling to the [[Labyrinth Cave]] to get a [[Gabite Scale]] for an ailing {{p|Shinx}}, and decided to attempt beating [[Team Poképals]] to the item. Unfortunately for Team Razor Wind, Gabite defeated them easily. It reappeared alongside its team in ''[[SS021|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky - Beyond Time & Darkness]]''.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Scyther's prototype name was "Stryke". This is a corruption of the word "strike", which is also its romanized Japanese name.
* Despite having different base stats, Scyther and its evolution, {{p|Scizor}}, both have a base stat total of 500. This makes Scyther the only pre-evolutionary form that has the same base stat total as its evolution.
* Scyther can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Pinsir}}. Both of them are {{type|Bug}} {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}}, with base stat totals of 500 and originally no evolution family. Scyther is exclusive to [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Red]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed]] and [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions|Diamond]], while Pinsir is exclusive to [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|LeafGreen]] and [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions|Pearl]].
* Scyther and {{p|Scizor}}, along with {{p|Pinsir}}, are the only Pokémon legitimately available in all 27 in-game [[Poké Ball]] variants.

===Origin===
Scyther draws much inspiration from a {{wp|praying mantis}} and more likely {{wp|mantidflies}} based on its agile mobility. However, its face is more {{wp|reptile|reptilian}}, with similarities to {{wp|dinosaur}}s and {{wp|dragon}}s.

====Name origin====
Scyther is a combination of ''scythe'' and the suffix ''{{tt|-er|thing that does an action}}'', in reference to its sharp blades.

Strike is literally ''strike''.
