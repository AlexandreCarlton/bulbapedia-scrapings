'''Ditto''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''メタモン''' ''Metamon'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It can [[Pokémon breeding|breed]] with any Pokémon other than the Pokémon in the {{egg|Undiscovered}} group and itself, including {{egg|Gender unknown|some genderless Pokémon}}, to produce Eggs of the other's species.

==Biology==
[[File:Duplica Ditto Pikachu.png|200px|thumb|left|[[Duplica]]'s Ditto {{m|transform}}ed as a {{p|Pikachu}}]]
In its natural state, Ditto is a light purple or magenta free-form blob with vestigial facial features. It also appears to have two vestigial, handless 'arms' protruding from its body. 

It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object, including its form and abilities. However, if Ditto tries to transform into something based on memory, it may get some of the details wrong. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming. [[EP037|The anime]] and [[Ditto (TCG)|the TCG]] have shown that occasionally a Ditto cannot change its face. Ditto will also be unable to remain in a transformed state if it starts laughing. When two Ditto meet in the wild, they will attempt to transform into each other. Ditto will also transform into a rock when sleeping to avoid attack. Ditto is never far from {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|civilization or people}}.

A Trainer in the [[Goldenrod Game Corner]] is seen with a Ditto in ''[[PS107|Gligar Glide]]''.

Ditto is seen later used by [[Team Rocket]] in ''[[PS127|Miltank Melee]]'', to lure {{adv|Crystal}} and [[Eusine]] away from {{p|Suicune}} and smother them when discovered. It was, however, defeated by Crystal's {{p|Hitmonchan}}, [[Monlee]].

==In the TCG==
{{main|Ditto (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
[[File:Ditto Melee.png|right|thumb|A screenshot of Ditto in Melee]]
Ditto was originally intended to be one of the Pokémon randomly released from a [[Poké Ball]]. It would have transformed into a copy of the user's character and aided them in battle. However, processing problems forced its removal before the game's release. Ditto can be still be unlocked through the debug menu (which is only accessible through the use of Action Replay), though it does not do anything other than give 7-8% damage to those who touch it.

As for its official status, Ditto only appears as a random trophy and as a cameo in the Tournament Mode menu. In Winner Out or Loser Out tournaments, holding down L and R and pressing A will give the player a random character and color. The usual character image will instead be taken by a picture of Ditto.

====Trophy information====
''Every Ditto has the ability to copy a Pokémon's entire cell structure in an instant and become its exact replica. They're terrible at remembering techniques, but when they use {{m|Transform}}, they temporarily learn all of their foe's moves. If a Ditto starts to laugh, it weakens and can't hold its transformation.''

==Trivia==
* Ditto is the only Pokémon to date with a [[catch rate]] of 35. However, in generations [[Generation III|III]] and [[Generation IV|IV]], if Ditto transforms into another Pokémon, its catch rate will become that of the new Pokémon.
* Ditto and {{p|Manaphy}} are the only Pokémon that are both able to breed yet unobtainable through breeding. Ditto, however, is the only one of the two that is not available at level 1 legally (legitimately the lowest level it is able to be is 10, in [[Generation II]] and its Generation IV [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions|remakes]]).
* In [[Pokémon Snap]], Ditto takes the form of {{p|Bulbasaur}} in the [[Pokémon Island Cave|Cave stage]]. The player can cause them to return to their Ditto form by hitting them with an object. When the player takes their picture, Ditto has the same eyes when it is transformed as when it is not. This trait is shared by [[Duplica]]'s Ditto in the [[EP037|anime]], although it was understood that this was not natural. {{TCG|Ditto|Ditto cards}} from the {{TCG|EX Delta Species}} {{Trading Card Game}} expansion and the Clefairy Ditto that may appear in the [[Veilstone Game Corner]]'s slot machines also have this trait.
* Ditto is one of two Pokémon to have two different species-specific [[Stat-enhancing item]]s associated with it, the other being {{p|Clamperl}}. Ditto's two associated items, the Metal Powder and Quick Powder, seem to be the same colors as Ditto's normal and {{Shiny}} forms, respectively.
* In [[Pokémon Rumble]], since {{m|Transform}} was not programmed into the game, Ditto can only know {{m|Struggle}}. Since PP does not exist in Rumble, this makes Ditto the only Pokémon in Rumble that can use Struggle. However, Transform does exist in [[Pokémon Rumble Blast]], so Ditto has a move.
* Ditto is the most common Pokémon in [[Pokémon Trozei!]], appearing in every area. This is due to its ability to transform, enabling the player a way to advance further if no links are available before Ditto appear.
* Ditto shares several aspects with {{p|Mew}}: the move {{m|Transform}}, the same {{Shiny}} blue and normal pink color, perfectly balanced base stats, and its weight of 8.8&nbsp;lbs. (4.0&nbsp;kg).
* Prior to [[Generation VI]], Ditto and {{p|Poliwag}} had the same [[cry]].
* Since Transform copies its target's stats (except HP), Ditto cannot utilize its Special Attack stat before Transforming, though it can use its Attack stat for {{m|Struggle}} and {{status|confusion}} damage.
* In [[Generation II]], a transformed Ditto keeps its original purple color palette (blue if Shiny).
* Since Ditto's only move, Transform, cannot copy moves in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series and has only one PP, its only move after transforming is Struggle.
* In Generation VI, Ditto is only given one move animation (despite the two animations minimum most Pokémon have for contact and non-contact moves).
* On October 4, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] posted a Ditto-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled [[Dit-to Ditto]].
* In [[Pokémon GO]], Ditto appears in the wild disguised as other Pokémon. After being caught, it will reveal its true form.

===Glitches===
====Index 000 post-capture====
In [[Generation I]], if the player manages to capture an [['M (00)]], it will still be in battle with the player, and the battle will not end. Catching 'M (00) again results in the second one becoming a Ditto of the same level.

====Ditto glitch====
{{main|Mew glitch#Ditto glitch|Mew glitch}}
The primary method of the Mew glitch involves having a wild Ditto transform into the player's Pokémon, as this copies the {{stat|Special}} stat, which is used to modify the species of Pokémon encountered.

====Transform assumption glitch====
In Generations {{gen|I}} and {{gen|II}}, any Pokémon that uses {{m|Transform}} is regarded as a Ditto in its new form; this means that if the player catches a {{p|Mew}} or a [[glitch Pokémon]] which has used the move Transform, or a Pokémon which has used Transform via {{m|Mirror Move}}, instead they will obtain a Ditto. Mew turning into Ditto was not an issue, because wild Mew could not have been legitimately encountered. This system was later changed in Generation III, where wild Mew could be legitimately encountered.

====Shiny Ditto glitch====
{{main|List of glitches in Generation II#Shiny Ditto DV manipulation}}
By trading any [[Shiny Pokémon]] to a Generation I game, having a wild Ditto transform into that Pokémon, then catching and trading the Ditto into a Generation II game, the Ditto will be Shiny.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|Unused Pokémon design revealed in magazine interview}}
In the sixth issue of {{wp|Best Buy}}'s @Gamer magazine, Game Freak developers Junichi Masuda and Ken Sugimori revealed that Ditto was originally based on the iconic {{wp|smiley}} face. Its eyes and mouth are exactly like ":)", which is an emoticon representing the smiley.

Additionally, Ditto strongly resembles an ''{{wp|amoeba}}'', a single-celled organism with no definite shape. This may emphasize its ability to alter its cellular composition. This could also explain why Ditto is unavailable through breeding, since single-celled organisms reproduce differently from multi-cellular plants and animals. It also could partially be based on an {{wp|undifferentiated cell}}, a cell in the body that can change into any other cell by sampling it. It could also have been based on a {{wp|blob}}.

====Name origin====
Ditto's name is the English word ''ditto'', meaning "that which has been said before" (itself from Italian, where it means "having been said"). It was also a brand name for spirit duplicators, and came to mean copies of master documents created by those duplicators.

Metamon is a combination of ''{{wp|metamorph}}'' and ''monster''. Alternatively, ''Meta'' as a prefix can mean "all-encompassing," which Ditto's {{m|Transform}} move does do to Pokémon.
