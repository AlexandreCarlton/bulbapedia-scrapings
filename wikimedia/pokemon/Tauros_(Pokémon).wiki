'''Tauros''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ケンタロス''' ''Kentauros'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, but it is considered to be a counterpart of {{p|Miltank}}.

==Biology==
Tauros is a quadruped, bovine Pokémon. It is covered in light brown fur with a thick, darker brown mane around the neck. It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, and three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead. A pair of curved, gray horns grows from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species with no true female counterpart.

Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. It lives and travels in herds on {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|plains and grasslands}}. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.

==Trivia==
* Tauros can be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Miltank}}. Both are bovine-like Pokémon with the same base stat total. While Tauros is a male-only species, Miltank is female-only species.
* Despite not being associated with a certain group, both Tauros and Miltank are listed on the same [[Pokédex]] page in {{g|Sun and Moon}}. The same trait is true with {{p|Oranguru}} and {{p|Passimian}}.
* In {{g|Sun and Moon}}, if the player has a Tauros with a Game Boy [[origin marking]], [[Game Freak]] [[Shigeki Morimoto|Morimoto]] remarks on how Tauros used to be one of the most powerful Pokémon in the metagame of the [[Generation I]] [[core series]] games, in part because it could learn {{m|Blizzard}}.
* Tauros forms a notable bug in [[Pokémon Play It!]], a game largely based on the Trading Card Game. Once the "Tauros" card appears, either in the player's own deck or that of the digital opponent, the game will shut down or freeze the computer.

===Origin===
It is based on a {{wp|Cattle|bull}} or a {{wp|bison}} and may also be based on the constellation ''{{wp|Taurus (constellation)|Taurus}}''. Its tail is based on a {{wp|whip}}, more specifically the {{wp|cat o' nine tails}}.

====Name origin====
Tauros may be a shorter form of its Japanese name, Kentauros. It is worth noting that ''tauros'' and ''taurus'' are, respectively, {{wp|Greek language|Greek}} and {{wp|Latin}} for ''bull''. Tauros could also be a corruption of ''toro'' ({{wp|Spanish language|Spanish}} for ''bull'', derived from the Latin).

Kentauros may be derived from the Japanese ケンタウロス ''{{wp|centaur}}'', which itself derives from the Greek Κένταυρος. It could also be a corruption of ''{{wp|Centaurus}}'', a large south-sky constellation representing a centaur.
