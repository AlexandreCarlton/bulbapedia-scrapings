'''Seaking''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アズマオウ''' ''Azumao'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Goldeen}} starting at [[level]] 33.

==Biology==
Seaking is a large, orange, fish-like Pokémon. It has billowing caudal and pectoral fins, all of which are white specked with black. However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid. It has round, dark eyes, prominent pink lips, small fangs, and a horn in the center of its forehead. Females have smaller horns than males.

Seaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|rivers and streams}}. It can not only swim against a river's current but it can travel up waterfalls. In the autumn spawning season, it travels upriver, where male Seaking, grown fattier and more vibrant in color, engage in elaborate dances to court females. Seaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its [[Pokémon Egg|Eggs]] from water currents. A mated pair takes turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month, and defends it with their lives.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Seaking's prototype name was "{{wp|Neptune (mythology)|Neptune}}", after the god of the sea in Roman mythology.
* Seaking and Goldeen are the only Pokémon that can learn {{m|Waterfall}} through leveling up.
* Seaking's number in the [[List of Pokémon by Sinnoh Pokédex number|Sinnoh Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are the same: 079.
* In [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|Gold, Silver]], and [[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]] Versions, it appears that Seaking was originally set to learn {{m|Supersonic}} as one of its three starting moves. However, the game programmers made an error and filled the third data slot with {{m|Tail Whip}}, so Seaking ended up with two starting moves instead.

===Origin===
It seems to be based on a species of {{wp|goldfish}} known as Azuma Nishiki (東錦), bearing a similar coloration to {{wp|shubunkin}} goldfish. The horn part may be based on Matsya, an avatar that the Hindu god {{wp|Vishnu}} assumed, which is sometimes depicted as a fish with a horn.

====Name origin====
Seaking is a combination of ''sea'' and ''king''. Additionally, it may be a pun on "sinking".

Azumao may be based on 小豆鱒 ''azukimasu'' ({{wp|rock cod}}) and 魔王 ''ma-ō'' (devil king). It may also be taken to literally mean 東王 ''azuma-ō'' (east king). Additionally, 東錦 ''azuma nishiki'' is a kind of goldfish and could be combined with 王 ''ou'' (king), as a compliment to Goldeen's "queenliness".
