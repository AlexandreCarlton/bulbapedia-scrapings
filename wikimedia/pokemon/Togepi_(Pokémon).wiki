'''Togepi''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''トゲピー''' ''Togepy'') is a {{type|Fairy}} [[baby Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Togetic}} when [[level]]ed up with high [[friendship]], which evolves into {{p|Togekiss}} when exposed to a [[Shiny Stone]].

==Biology==
Togepi is a small, light yellow Pokémon with a round body that is still encased in its eggshell. Togepi does not shed its shell. The Egg has red and blue shapes on it. Togepi has stubby hands and round feet with two toes each. Togepi has black eyes and five spikes on its head that seem to form a crown. It also has semi-oval, brown pads on the soles of its feet.

Togepi is able to release poison from the spikes on its head. [[EP054|The anime]] has shown that it can retract into its shell, which it usually does to sleep. It is able to siphon the positive energy of others, and then release it to those in need of it. It has a very joyful nature. As a result, it is said that it shares its joy with those who take care of it. Because of its disposition, Togepi is seen as a sign of good luck, especially if a Trainer is capable of getting a sleeping Togepi to stand. Although rare in the wild, Togepi can most commonly be found living within the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}.

[[File:Togepi Egg.png|thumb|left|200px|A Togepi {{pkmn|Egg}} in the anime]]
In ''[[EP046|Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon]]'', {{Ash}} found a [[Pokémon Egg]]. It hatched into a {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} in ''[[EP050|Who Gets to Keep Togepi?]]'', and since {{an|Misty}} was the first thing the [[baby Pokémon]] saw, it believed Misty to be its mother. At the end of ''[[AG045|A Togepi Mirage!]]'', [[Princess Sara]] found the Togepi of Legend, and Misty left her Togepi, which had just evolved to {{p|Togetic}}, in the [[Mirage Kingdom]] to guard other Togepi in the [[Togepi Paradise]].

====Other====
Multiple Togepi appeared in ''[[AG045|A Togepi Mirage!]]'' living in the [[Togepi Paradise]]. [[Princess Sara]] caught one of them.

An unusually bratty female Togepi appeared in ''[[DP142|Where No Togepi Has Gone Before!]]''. She used her cute qualities to manipulate people so she could cause mischief.

A Togepi appeared in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

A Togepi will appear in [[M21]], under the ownership of Hisui.

===Minor appearances===
A Togepi appeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', where it was playfully chasing a {{p|Chikorita}}.

==In the manga==
[[File:Togebo Togepi.png|thumb|200px|Togepi in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
[[File:Togebo Egg.png|thumb|150px|A Togepi {{pkmn|Egg}} in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Togebo}}
{{adv|Gold}} was given an Egg created by [[Jasmine]]'s Togetic from [[Professor Elm]] that later hatched into a Togepi named [[Togebo]]. Togebo's Egg first appeared in ''[[PS095|Stantler By Me]]'', but Togebo wouldn't officially appear until ''[[PS107|Gligar Glide]]''. Due to his abilities as a hatcher, Togebo was born with Gold's trouble-making habits, much to Professor Elm's displeasure. Despite this, Gold wasn't able to truly connect with Togebo until the climax of the {{chap|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}, where he evolves into a Togetic and then a Togekiss via a [[Shiny Stone]].

In ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' another Togepi was one of the Pokémon sent to help the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

In ''[[PS442|Out-Odding Oddish]]'', a Togepi appeared in the [[Pokéathlon]].

===In the Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga===
In [[Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys|The Golden Boys]], Togepi is one of the Pokémon owned by {{OBP|Chris|Golden Boys}}. It was the Egg hatched from [[Professor Elm]]'s {{key|II|Mystery Egg}}.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
{{main|Misty's Togepi}}
{{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} borrowed [[Misty's Togepi]] in ''[[PM054|The Pokémon Banana League (Part 1)]]''. Later on in the chapter, he returns it back.
{{main|Red's Togepi}}
Red also owned a Togepi that hatched in ''[[PM062|Welcome Back, Clefairy!!]]'' and was later traded away for a {{TP|Red|Tyrogue}} in ''[[PM085|Togepi's Determination]]''.

===In the Magical Pokémon Journey manga===
{{main|Togepi (MPJ)}}
Togepi is a Pokémon in the [[Magical Pokémon Journey]] series which first appeared in ''[[PPP06-03|Eggcellent Togepi]]''.

==In the TCG==

==Other appearances==
[[File:Togepi SSBB.png|220px|thumb|Togepi in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Togepi will use {{m|Metronome}} which will trigger {{m|Night Shade}}, {{m|Magnitude}}, {{m|Sing}}, {{m|Ice Beam}}, or {{m|Leech Seed}}.

====Melee trophy information====
''These adorable Spike Ball Pokémon hatch from eggs given out by [[Professor Elm]]'s assistant. Common superstition holds that their shells are chock-full of happiness and that they become good-luck charms when handled with kindness. It's impossible to predict which ability a Togepi will call upon when it uses its {{m|Metronome}} move, so you'd better be ready!''

The Melee trophy incorrectly states that Togepi's first appearance was in Pokémon Gold and Silver. Togepi's first appearance was actually in [[Hey You, Pikachu!]].

====Brawl trophy information====

''"A Spike Ball Pokémon. It's said that its shell is filled with joy, and a proverb asserts that if you can get a sleeping Togepi to stand up, you will gain happiness. Togepi can lower its opponent's attack power using {{m|Charm}}. Once it has become friends with its Trainer, Togepi evolves into Togetic."''
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Togepi once again appears as a Poké Ball summon. After being released, it will use {{m|Metronome}} to trigger either {{m|Night Shade}} (causes stage darkness), {{m|Leech Seed}} (plants flower for gradual damage), {{m|Hypnosis}} (puts to sleep), {{m|Icy Wind}} (freezes) or {{m|Earthquake}} (traps in the ground).
====Trophy information====
'''NA:''' ''This Fairy-type Pokémon grows by feeding off the happiness, fun, and kindness of others. It's always filled with joy! In Smash Bros., Togepi uses the unpredictable Metronome move on foes. This move can cause drowsiness, damaging-flower growth, or stage darkness.''

'''PAL:''' ''A Fairy-type Pokémon that's always sunny side up! It can siphon positive energy from people and spread it across the world. Its Metronome attack can have a wide variety of effects. Maybe it'll plunge the stage into darkness. Maybe it'll plant damage-dealing seeds on fighters' heads. Whatever it does, Togepi will leave fighters scrambling.''

===[[Pokémon mini]]===
Togepi appears in the Pokémon mini game [[Togepi's Great Adventure]].

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Togepi is the leader of Team Glee, along with {{p|Politoed}} and {{p|Ledyba}}.

==Trivia==
* Togepi is the second [[Generation II]] Pokémon (after {{p|Ho-Oh}}) to appear in the Kanto series of the anime. It is also the first future generation Pokémon with a known name at the time of its appearance to appear in the anime.
* The Togepi that is hatched from the Egg from [[Mr. Pokémon]] in {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}} will know {{m|Extrasensory}}, a move normally only available as an [[Egg Move]].
* While [[baby Pokémon]] are often revealed before the generation they debut in, Togepi is so far the only [[baby Pokémon]] to be revealed before {{p|Togetic|its evolution}}.
* On the DVD scene selection screen from ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'', Togepi is listed as Pokémon #152.
* In [[Pokémon Rumble Blast]], when Togepi is attacking, it makes a different cry than its usual one that is heard.
** When it faints, however, the normal fainting cry it makes in the other games is heard.

===Origin===
Togepi appears to be based on the concept of a baby hatchling of any of a number of species of animals. It could also possibly be based on an Egg, with its evolutions based loosely on birds.

====Name origin====
Togepi and Togepy may be a combination of 刺 ''toge'' (spike) and ピヨピヨ ''piyopiyo'' (onomatopoeia for a bird chirping). It may also be a corruption of {{wp|Dokkaebi}}, usually pronounced ''tokebi'' in Japanese, which is a mythical being of Korean folklore.
