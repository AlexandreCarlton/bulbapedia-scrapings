'''Slowpoke''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤドン''' ''Yadon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Slowbro}} starting at [[level]] 37 or {{p|Slowking}} when [[trade]]d holding a [[King's Rock]].

==Biology==
Slowpoke is a pink creature that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. Its vacant eyes never seem focused, and it has curled ears and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses it as a lure for fishing, and it will grow back if cut off. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.

Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|water's edge.}}

==In the anime==

===Major appearances===
Slowpoke briefly debuted in ''[[EP017|Island of the Giant Pokémon]]''. {{Ash}}'s Pokémon asked it for help, but it didn't respond. It evolved into a {{p|Slowbro}} at the very end of the episode.

Slowpoke was seen in ''[[EP066|The Evolution Solution]]''. Ash and {{ashfr}} asked for the help of [[Professor Westwood V]] to help figure out why Slowpoke only evolved into Slowbro when a {{DL|List of Pokémon temporarily owned by the Team Rocket trio|Shellder}} {{m|clamp}}ed on its tail (a question that was giving {{an|Professor Oak}} a headache). Westwood's Slowpoke evolved when a Shellder that [[Jessie]] caught clamped on to the Dopey Pokémon's tail.

''[[EP142|A Shadow of a Drought]]'' revealed that [[Azalea Town]] considers Slowpoke sacred due to legends claiming that Slowpoke's {{m|yawn}}ing can summon rain.

''[[EP244|Enlighten Up!]]'' introduced practitioners of a religion similar to {{wp|Buddhism}} that see Slowpoke's empty head as a sign of enlightenment and worship by meditating along with Slowpoke and Slowbro.

In ''[[EP260|A Crowning Achievement]]'', a group of Slowpoke were trying to reach a [[King's Rock]] to evolve into Slowking in order to help find a better habitat for the group. In this episode, a Slowpoke evolved into a Slowking when its head was bitten by a Shellder while it was wearing the King's Rock.

==Trivia==
[[File:Bandai Aerodactyl card.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Ken Sugimori]] artwork showing Slowpoke's striped underside]]
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Slowpoke was originally known as "Slowmo".
* The Japanese and international {{game3|Gold and Silver|Pokémon Silver|s}} have different sprites for Slowpoke, with the Japanese versions having a fatter and striped belly similar to that which Slowbro and Slowking sport. It is unknown why this was changed. However, its striped underside is still partially visible in all of its Gold and Crystal sprites. This striped belly does not appear to be a true error, as it has been seen in artwork by [[Ken Sugimori]], though it is from [[Generation I]].
* Like {{p|Mantyke}}, Slowpoke evolves when another Pokémon attaches to it; however, this was only seen in the anime. Proximity-based evolution such as requiring Mantyke and {{p|Remoraid}} to be in the same party were not introduced until [[Generation IV]]. Despite the fact that other Pokémon, such as {{p|Feebas}}, have been given additional evolution methods for evolving into the same Pokémon, Shellder still has no bearing on Slowpoke's evolution.
* Slowpoke is the only Pokémon whose multiple evolutions have different total [[EV yield]]s: {{p|Slowbro}} has an EV yield of 2, while {{p|Slowking}} has an EV yield of 3.
* Slowpoke is the only Pokémon whose National Pokédex number is the same as its weight in pounds when rounded.
* Despite numerous Pokédex entries stating its lack of response to a bite on its tail, in [[Pokémon Snap]] it is shown to quickly react to Shellder's bite. This may be due to Shellder's venom stimulating a quicker response, or simply an error or game mechanic to speed the process along.
* The Pokémon Company posted a Slowpoke-themed reggae music video onto their Japanese channel titled ''What's Going on, Yadon?''. The song was later dubbed and posted to the English-language channel under the title of ''[[Slowpoke Song]]''.
* Though the species has appeared repeatedly, no Slowpoke has ever been seen using an attack in the anime.
* Slowpoke has the lowest {{stat|Speed}} of all {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Slowpoke, Slowbro and Slowking}}
Due to its marine nature, shape and association with {{wp|shellfish}}, Slowpoke may be based on various species of {{wp|otter}}. It may also be based on a {{wp|giant salamander}} or {{wp|hippopotamus}}.

Its ability to regenerate its own tail if cut off refers to {{wp|autotomy}}.

====Name origin====
Slowpoke is literally ''slowpoke'', a term for someone who is slow. It can be also a combination of ''slow'' and ''poke'' (an abbreviation of ''Pokémon'').

Yadon may be a combination of 宿借り ''yadokari'' ({{wp|hermit crab}}) and ''donkan'' (thickheaded or stolid), whereas 鈍 ''don'' means slow, dull, or stupid. Alternatively, it may also derive from 宿主 ''yadonushi'' ([parasitic] host), based on its relationship with {{p|Shellder}} in its evolutions.
