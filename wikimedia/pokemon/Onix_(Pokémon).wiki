'''Onix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イワーク''' ''Iwark'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Steelix}} when [[trade]]d holding a [[Metal Coat]].

==Biology==
Onix resembles a giant chain of gray boulders that become smaller towards the tail. It has a rocky spine on its head and a pair of black eyes right beneath it. This Pokémon has a magnet in its brain that serves as an internal compass. Its body absorbs many hard objects, making its body very solid. As it grows older, it becomes more rounded and smoother, eventually becoming similar to black diamonds.

Onix tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by {{p|Diglett}}. Onix loves to eat the large boulders it encounters while burrowing underground. As seen in the [[Pokémon Stadium series]], Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pokémon that will constantly attack humans and other Pokémon when in pain, as seen in [[EP071|the anime]]. Onix can be found in mountains and {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|caves}}, though it prefers underground tunnels with little light.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Brock's Onix]]=====
[[Brock's Onix]] debuted in ''[[EP005|Showdown in Pewter City]]''.

At some point before ''[[AG177|Grating Spaces]]'', it evolved into a {{p|Steelix}}.

=====[[Bruno's Onix]]=====
{{Ash}} and his friends encountered a {{pkmn2|giant}} {{TP|Bruno|Onix}} in ''[[EP071|To Master the Onixpected]]''. It was on a rampage until [[Bruno]] managed to pull a {{p|Sandslash}} out from two of its boulders. Bruno captured the Onix afterwards.

=====[[Crystal Onix]]=====
''[[EP087|The Crystal Onix]]'' featured a special Onix whose body is made out of glass crystal. Ash and {{ashfr}} helped a glass sculptor named [[Mateo]] search for it because Mateo believed it would help inspire him to be better at his craft.

==Trivia==
* Onix is the only unevolved Pokémon that is used in the [[Pokémon World Tournament]] by Trainers beyond the right attendant.
* Of all the Pokémon that can [[Evolution|evolve]], Onix has the highest base Defense.
* The Onix line is the only one which can be completely acquired with [[in-game trade]]s. However, this is only possible in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, in which the player can trade {{p|Bellsprout}} for Onix in [[Violet City]], and any Pokémon for Steelix in [[Olivine City]].
* The [[Lagging Tail]] [[held item]] resembles the end of Onix's tail.
* Onix is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Rock}} Pokémon and tallest Pokémon that can evolve.
* Onix is the only [[Gigantic Pokémon]] that can evolve. 

===Origin===
Onix is most likely based on a combination of a {{wp|snake}} and {{wp|earthworm}}. It may also been based on the {{wp|European dragon|wyrm}}, a type of dragon that has been presented as limbless and burrowing.

====Name origin====
Onix is a corruption of ''{{wp|onyx}}'' (a mineral).

Iwark may be a combination of 岩 ''iwa'' (rock) and スネーク ''snake''.
