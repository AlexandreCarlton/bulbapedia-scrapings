'''Kyogre''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイオーガ''' ''Kyogre'') is a {{type|Water}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can undergo [[Primal Reversion]] and become '''Primal Kyogre''' if it holds the [[Blue Orb]].

Kyogre possesses the ability to expand the oceans. In ancient times, it came into conflict with {{p|Groudon}}, a Pokémon with the ability to expand continents. In {{game3|Ruby and Sapphire|Pokémon Sapphire|s}}, {{v2|Emerald}}, and [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Alpha Sapphire]], Kyogre is sought after by [[Team Aqua]] as part of their plot to create more habitats for aquatic Pokémon by raising the sea level.

Kyogre is the [[game mascot]] of Pokémon Sapphire and its remake, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, with Kyogre appearing on the box art of Sapphire and Primal Kyogre appearing on the box art of Alpha Sapphire.

Along with {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Rayquaza}}, Kyogre is a part of the [[weather trio]].

==Biology==
Kyogre is a massive whale-like Pokémon with two big pectoral fins, each with four white square-shaped nails. It has a deep blue body and a white chin area with two small spikes protruding under it. Above each eye are two white, oval-shaped spots. It has red stripes around its chin, eyes, dorsal fins, and torso. These stripes glow when Kyogre is brimming with power. The tail is tattered with four trailing parts, the inner ones being smaller than the outer. Its eyes are small, yellow, and shadowed with black.

Primal Kyogre is similar to Kyogre, but it grows to more than twice its usual size. Its skin color changes to a darker shade of blue. The four trailing parts of its tail are considerably longer and flat at the ends, and each have half-translucent webbing down the middle. Its forehead now has the {{tt|α|Alpha}} symbol, which is connected to the two large oval-shaped spots and tail, and light blue {{tt|α|Alpha}} symbols are seen on each pectoral fin, connecting to the outer nails with a red marking connecting to the inner nails. The red stripes adorning its body become light blue. There are two yellow shaped symbols inside the oval-shaped spots. The white parts of Kyogre's body, as well as the areas between the markings on the pectoral fins, become half-translucent. A mysterious golden light glows from within Primal Kyogre's body.<ref name="Primal">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-kyogre</ref> In the [[SS031|anime]], Primal Kyogre is said to have widened the seas by a large margin simply by taking a swim.

Kyogre is said to be a powerful Pokémon, having control over the element of water and rain to have quenched areas of the world plagued with drought and to have expanded the seas. Kyogre is normally calm and peaceful, but if it meets its rival, {{p|Groudon}}, Kyogre will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. In the {{DL|Spin-off Pokémon games|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series|Mystery Dungeon series}} and [[core series]], Kyogre is able to fly. Kyogre generally lives deep in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|ocean}}, and is said to rest in a deep trench. Kyogre is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Origin Pulse}}.

[[File:Kyogre M09.png|thumb|left|250px|Kyogre in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
[[File:Primal Kyogre anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Primal Kyogre in the anime]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime#Kyogre|Kyogre (anime)]]=====
Kyogre appeared in ''[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]''. [[Team Magma]] had captured Kyogre but didn't have the correct orb to control it. Team Magma planned to make a trade with [[Team Aqua]], who had captured Groudon. The trade was about to be made when [[Archie]] decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen. The {{pkmn|battle}} between Kyogre and Groudon occurred during the following episode, ''[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]''.

=====Other=====
A Kyogre appeared in ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]''. It had appeared along with countless other Water Pokémon when {{Ash}} replaced all of the [[Sea Crown]]'s crystals. However, when [[The Phantom]] attempted to make all the Water types panic using supersonic waves from his ship, Kyogre too was part of the ensuing commotion. {{OBP|Manaphy|M09}} calmed them down using {{m|Heart Swap}} to rid the Pokémon of their confusion, and some {{p|Wailord}} broke open The Phantom's ship, followed by some {{p|Chinchou}} swimming into the opening and short-circuiting the ship. Kyogre then used {{m|Hyper Beam}} on the ship, destroying it.

A Kyogre made a cameo appearance in ''[[SS031|Mega Evolution Special II]]'', where it was shown being awakened by the presence of the [[Giant Rock]]. It played a bigger role in ''[[SS032|Mega Evolution Special III]]'', where it was shown in its [[Primal Reversion|primal state]] fighting with Primal Groudon over the Giant Rock. It also fought [[Steven's Metagross|Steven's Mega Metagross]], and was almost defeated by it until Metagross was defeated by {{me|Rayquaza}}. The same Kyogre reappeared in flashbacks during ''[[XY092|Cloudy Fate, Bright Future!]]'' and ''[[XY138|The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!]]''.

A Kyogre briefly appeared in the beginning of ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', being one of the many Pokémon summoned by {{an|Hoopa}} to defeat in the past. A Primal Kyogre later appeared as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real Hoopa in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Primal Kyogre and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Primal Kyogre departed for its home.

Kyogre debuted in the opening sequence of ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]''.

A Kyogre made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

A wild Kyogre appeared in ''[[PG08|The Cavern]]'', where it was awoken by [[Archie]] inside the [[Seafloor Cavern]], who used the [[Blue Orb]] to turn it into its [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] form. It escaped the Cavern and swam through its surrounding waters and surfaced above the ocean before creating a massive storm, threatening to destroy [[Hoenn]]. It was last seen attacking Archie and other members of [[Team Aqua]] when he tried to calm it down.

''"A Sea Basin Pokémon. It brought down heavy rains, which formed seas and relieved droughts. It is usually found slumbering at the bottom of an ocean trench.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Water-type Pokémon roughly resembles an orca whale, though its large fins also look a bit like hands. Be wary of its Hydro Pump attack, which is capable of sending you flying off the stage. Even worse, it will chase after you, making it even harder to recover from the attack.''

'''PAL''': ''This orca-like Water-type Pokémon is known for the distinctive shape of its fins and the red markings along its body. It will use Hydro Pump to send fighters flying off the stage, and then proceed to chase after them to make recovering from the attack a nightmare. ''

==Trivia==
[[File:Marina.png|thumb|Marina's Kyogre Costume]]
* In games prior to [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], Kyogre has a catch rate of 5.
* [[Palace Maven Spenser]] has a staff with Kyogre's markings on it.
* Primal Kyogre has the highest {{stat|Special Attack}} base stat, {{stat|Special Defense}} base stat, and base stat total of all {{type|Water}} Pokémon.
* In [[Pokémon Battle Revolution]], Marina has a [[Pokémon cosplay|costume]] based on Kyogre.
* In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, a Kyogre that knows {{m|Surf}} will allow the player to travel more quickly on water than with other Pokémon. This action has its own animation and larger hitbox.
** Additionally, a Kyogre that knows {{m|Dive}} will allow the player to avoid underwater trainer battles. This action also has its own animation and larger hitbox.
* Primal Kyogre is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{type|Water}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Kyogre may be modeled after the Earth's oceans and may be based on the Hebrew legends of {{wp|Leviathan}}, the unconquerable primal master of the sea. Its counterparts were {{wp|Behemoth}} and {{wp|Ziz}}. Just as Kyogre is in conflict with Groudon, it was said that at the end of time Leviathan and Behemoth would start a battle that would kill them both. The Hebrew word for Leviathan is now used for whales in modern Hebrew, which may be why Kyogre's appearance also draws inspiration from whales, especially the {{wp|orca}}.

====Name origin====
Kyogre may be a combination of 海 ''kai'' (ocean) and ''{{wp|killer whale|orca}}'' (a species described as a whale, but is more closely related to dolphins). Notably, it may also involve 海王 ''kaiō'' (king of the sea), which are the first two characters in 海王星 ''Kaiōsei'' ({{wp|Neptune}}).
