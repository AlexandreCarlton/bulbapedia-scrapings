'''Zapdos''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サンダー''' ''Thunder'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Moltres}}, it is one of the three [[Legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]].

==Biology==
Zapdos is a large avian Pokémon with predominantly yellow plumage. Black rings encircle its eyes, and it has a long, thin, light orange beak. Its wings and tail are a mass of spiky feathers, with black feathers covering the back of its wings and inner tail feathers. A large crest of spiked feathers surrounds its head. Its thighs are a khaki color, and it has {{wp|Bird anatomy|anisodactyl}} feet ending in talons.

When Zapdos flaps its glittering wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms. It produces massive crackling and snapping sounds when it flies; these are attributed to the lightning bolts it sheds when airborne. When stricken by lightning, it gains power. Zapdos reportedly appears only during thunderstorms, and is said to live among thunderclouds. However, it is {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rarely seen.}}

==In the anime==

===In the main series===
[[File:Zapdos M02.png|thumb|251px|Zapdos in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====

=====[[Legendary birds (M02)#Zapdos|Zapdos (M02)]]=====
Zapdos debuted in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]''. [[Lawrence III]] wanted to capture the three [[Legendary birds]] as well as their master {{mov|Lugia|Lugia|02}}.

=====Other=====
Zapdos made its main series debut in ''[[EP242|As Clear As Crystal]]''. When {{TRT}} made an attempt to steal a crystal that gave a lake the ability to heal {{type|Electric}} Pokémon, they were side-tracked when Zapdos showed up and they changed their objective to capture Zapdos instead.

The [[Dr. Yung|Mirage Master]] briefly wielded the power of a Mirage Zapdos in ''[[The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon]]''.

A Zapdos appeared in ''[[XY110|An Electrifying Rage!]]''. It was first seen flying across the sky by {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}. {{TRT}} later made an attempt to capture Zapdos, which infuriated it, forcing {{Ash}} to battle it with {{AP|Talonflame}}, {{AP|Hawlucha}}, and newly-evolved {{AP|Noivern}}. When Team Rocket continued their attempt, Noivern and {{AP|Pikachu}} helped save Zapdos and calm it down.

====Minor appearances====
A Zapdos appeared in ''[[EP229|An EGG-sighting Adventure!]]'' as part of {{TRT}}'s fantasy.

A Zapdos appeared in the ending credits of ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]''. [[Jackie]] captured it with a [[Capture Styler]] and flew away on its back.

A Zapdos made a cameo appearance in ''[[DP094|Doc Brock!]]''. This may have been taken from {{game|Platinum}}, where a Zapdos could be seen {{pkmn2|roaming}} throughout Sinnoh.

A Zapdos made a cameo appearance in a flashback in ''[[DP173|Dealing With a Fierce Double Ditto Drama!]]'', and both of [[Narissa]]'s {{p|Ditto}} {{m|transform}}ed into it.

A Zapdos made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''.

A Zapdos made a brief cameo in the opening sequence of ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', where it was seen flying across the sky.

A Zapdos made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''.

A Zapdos appeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]''.

{{-}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Lt Surge Zapdos Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Zapdos in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Legendary birds (M02)|Zapdos (M02)}}
Zapdos plays a major role in the second [[Pokémon movie]], ''[[M02|The Power of One]]''. Likewise, it appears in the {{ma|Mirage Pokémon Lugia's Explosive Birth|manga adaptation}} of the film by [[Tanigami Toshio]].

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Legendary birds (Adventures)#Zapdos|Zapdos (Adventures)}}
Having captured this Legendary bird in [[Kanto Power Plant|the abandoned Power Plant]] in ''[[PS026|Holy Moltres]]'' as in the games, [[Lt. Surge]] appears with Zapdos in his team during the events of {{PAV|3}}, using it as a never-ending power source for his Electric types, allowing them to continually shock {{adv|Red}} at full force, a strategy that turns against him when Red uses [[Saur]]'s {{m|Razor Leaf}} to cut the supply cords and his insulating underwear with them. After having been merged with {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Moltres}} into {{DL|Legendary birds (Adventures)|Thu-Fi-Zer|an undiscovered Pokémon}}, the three Pallet Town Trainers are able to defeat the combined monster, so it leaves his team, and [[Team Rocket]] afterwards to go back to the wild.

{{adv|Green}} later captures Zapdos before the {{chap|Gold, Silver, & Crystal}} and uses it against [[Will]] and [[Karen]], having caught it and its Legendary bird companions on her personal training journey to overcome her fear of birds. During this battle, it is lent to {{adv|Blue}} when things get rough. Once returned, it is put back in its [[Poké Ball]] and isn't seen again, meaning it has either been deposited into her box or released.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
A Zapdos debuted in ''[[PM017|Regain the Deserted Power Plant!]]''.

Two other Zapdos appeared in ''[[PM058|Get Lugia!]]'' and [[PMDP11]], respectively.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Zapdos (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When released from a Poké Ball, Zapdos uses a powerful {{m|Thunder Shock}} that hits opponents several times to produce a substantial amount of damage.

====Trophy information====
''Zapdos flaps its wings, and summer storms appear, throwing lightning every which way. It's said that you can hear this legendary Pokémon coming, as its wings make a very distinctive popping sound as it flies. In addition to electrical moves like the dreaded {{m|Thunder}}, it also wields a vicious move called {{m|Drill Peck}}.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]===
Zapdos appears in the background of the {{st|Prism Tower}} stage in the 3DS version of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Gazing up at dark storm clouds gathering in the sky, many children must have once wondered if the Pokémon they saw in the [[M02|second Pokémon movie]] was in the clouds. An innocent and childish dream, perhaps... but even today as adults, the sound of thunder might just bring back memories of this Legendary bird Pokémon.''

'''PAL''': ''Gazing up at dark storm clouds gathering in the sky, many children must once have wondered if the Pokémon they just saw in the latest movie was lurking somewhere in their depths. An innocent and childish dream, perhaps...but even today as adults, the sound of thunder might just bring back memories of this Legendary Bird Pokémon.''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* Zapdos is the first Legendary Pokémon encountered in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]. After it kidnaps {{p|Shiftry}}, the player must fight it at the top of [[Mt. Thunder]]. It is possible to recruit Zapdos by returning for another fight after the credits.

==Trivia==
* Of all Legendary Pokémon with fixed in-game locations, Zapdos can be obtained with the fewest number of Badges: 3. In the [[Generation I]] games and [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|their remakes]], the player can catch Zapdos with only the {{Badge|Boulder}}, {{Badge|Cascade}}, and {{Badge|Soul}}.
* Zapdos shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Elekid}} and {{p|Electabuzz}}. They are all known as the Electric Pokémon.
* Zapdos and {{p|Jolteon}}'s Japanese names are almost exactly the same as each other's, with a final ''s'' being the only difference.
* Zapdos possesses a type advantage over all other members of its trio, as well as its trio master, {{p|Lugia}}.
* In the {{pkmn|anime}} episode ''[[EP036|The Bridge Bike Gang]]'', [[Chopper]]'s bike was decorated to look like a Zapdos.
===Origin===
Zapdos may be based on the {{wp|Native American}} legend of the {{wp|thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird}}. The thunderbird was known for being the spirit of thunder, lightning, and rain in the form of a giant bird. The beating of the wings was said to create thunder. It may also have been based on the {{wp|lightning bird}}, a bird created from wherever lightning hits the earth. Aesthetically it may also be based of {{wp|hummingbirds}}, due to the long beak, the rather simple wings and described violent behaviour.

===Name origin===
Zapdos is a combination of ''zap'' and ''dos'' ({{wp|Spanish language|Spanish}} for ''two'', indicating that it is the second in the series of [[Kanto]] [[Legendary birds]]).

Thunder is literally ''thunder''.
