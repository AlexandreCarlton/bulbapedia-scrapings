'''Skarmory''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''エアームド''' ''Airmd'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
Skarmory is a silver-gray, avian Pokémon with a long, metallic blue neck, legs, and tail. It has yellow eyes, a pointed beak with several pointed teeth, and a triangular crest on its head. There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 180&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends.

Its steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges. Its feathers are sharp enough to be used as blades. Its skin and feathers are solid because it lives and is raised in very {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|harsh conditions}}. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of its skin will eventually harden it into an iron-like state. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient [[Alola]], warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory as swords.

==Trivia==
* Skarmory has the highest base {{stat|Defense}} of all {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* Skarmory's number in the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] and [[List of Pokémon by Unova Pokédex number#List of Pokémon by New Unova Pokédex number|New Unova Pokédex]] are the same: 203.

===Origin===
Skarmory has much in common with the {{wp|Andean Condor}} and {{wp|Crane (bird)|crane}}s, birds which are held in high esteem in Japan. It is also similar to many mythological, metallic birds such as the {{wp|Stymphalian bird}}s, the {{wp|Gagana}}, and the {{wp|Alicanto}}.

Its concept could also be a pun on 鶴 ''tsuru'' (crane), referencing a paper crane, and 剣 ''tsurugi'' (sword). Its wings also resemble a Japanese paper {{wp|hand fan}}.

====Name origin====
Skarmory is a combination of ''sky'' and ''{{wp|armory}}'' or ''armor''. It may also include ''scar'', given how its sharp body could easily wound its prey and even leave them with scars; ''scar'' may also refer to Skarmory's own skin, being cut repeatedly in brambles when it is young and building up the harder, callused or scar-like tissue which makes up its steely hide as an adult.

Airmd may be based on ''air'' or a pun on ''armed'' or ''armored''.
