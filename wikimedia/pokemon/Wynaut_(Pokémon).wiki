'''Wynaut''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ソーナノ''' ''Sohnano'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[baby Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Wobbuffet}} starting at [[level]] 15.

==Biology==
Wynaut is a small, bipedal Pokémon covered in blue fur. Its head is spherical with ear-like, fingerless arms on either side and a bulbous growth on its forehead. It has a wide mouth with a serrated upper jaw and a pink tongue. Its eyes appear closed, each curving upward to a point in the center. The fur on its body ends in a zigzag pattern, extending over its short legs. Wynaut's tail is long and completely black, ending in a round, flattened tip with a white, eye-like spot.

Wynaut tends to live in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}} and travel in herds. It will test its endurance by squeezing up against other Wynaut at night. In doing so, it strengthens itself, toughens its spirit, and learns to deal powerful counterattacks. When angered, it will slap the ground with its tail. As it loves to eat sweet fruit, it is also drawn to fruit gardens.

==In the anime==

===Major appearances===
====[[Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime#Wynaut|Wynaut (anime)]]====
Wynaut debuted during the [[Blackthorn City]] arc, which began in ''[[EP252|Fangs for Nothin']]'' and ended in ''[[EP255|Why? Wynaut!]]''. However, [[Jessie's Wobbuffet]], [[Ash's Bayleef]], and [[Ash's Noctowl]] were the only ones to see it throughout the entire storyline.

====Other====
A Wynaut appeared in ''[[PK11|Camp Pikachu]]''. It helped {{AP|Pikachu}} and its friends, including the [[Pichu Brothers]], get to the Pichu Brothers' next train to [[Big Town]]. At the end of the episode, the same Wynaut called several other Wynaut, apparently its friends, to help the gang move a cart in order to reach the train.

Multiple Wynaut appeared in ''[[AG113|Who, What, When, Where, Wynaut?]]'' as the only inhabitants of {{gdis|Mirage Island|III}}. In the episode, a plan of {{TRT}}'s backfired and sent everyone to that island.

A Wynaut was seen among other baby Pokémon who were under the care of [[Normajean]] in ''[[DP190|The Brockster Is In!]]'', and, like the others, was nursed back to health by {{an|Brock}}'s newly evolved {{TP|Brock|Chansey}}.

Three Wynaut appeared in ''[[XY063|A Fork in the Road! A Parting of the Ways!]]'', under ownership of [[Dr. White]].

===Minor appearances===
A Wynaut appeared in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

A Wynaut appeared in ''[[XY092|Cloudy Fate, Bright Future!]]'', under the ownership of a {{tc|Psychic}}.

{{Animedexbody|AG113|Wynaut|May's Pokédex|Wynaut, the Bright Pokémon. Wynaut are the pre-evolved form of {{p|Wobbuffet}}. They travel in herds and at {{DL|Time|night}}, and retire to caves where they sleep together in groups.}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Wynaut AP.png|thumb|200px|Wynaut in [[Ash & Pikachu]]]]
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
A Wynaut first made a cameo as one of the many Trainer-owned Pokémon who were transported to stop {{p|Ho-Oh}} and {{p|Lugia}}'s rampage in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]''. 

In ''[[PS256|With a Spoink in Your Step II]]'', many wild Wynaut made an appearance on {{gdis|Mirage Island|III}}, where {{adv|Ruby}} and {{adv|Sapphire}} trained for the upcoming battle against [[Maxie]] and [[Archie]].

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]: {{p|Wobbuffet}} and Wynaut send the player on a mission into the [[Uproar Forest]]. As thanks for completing it, they help to remodel the rescue base. Wynaut also makes an appearance discussing the identity of the strongest Pokémon with {{p|Lombre}} and {{p|Bellsprout}} in the cutscene that unlocks the [[Western Cave]].
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky]]: A different Wobbuffet and Wynaut duo appear in Explorers of Sky, first seen examining a rock outside of [[Treasure Town]]. Several days later, the two are seen standing outside an entrance where the rock once was, and usher the player and partner into what is revealed to be [[Spinda's Café]], where the pair manage the [[Spinda's Café#Recycle Shop|Recycle Shop]]. Later in the game, Wynaut informs the player of any new areas discovered after the introduction of Spinda's [[Spinda's Café#Project P|Project P]].

==Trivia==
* In [[Generation III]], Wynaut is the only baby Pokémon found in the wild in the games, on {{gdis|Mirage Island|III}}. Oddly, in [[Generation IV]], Wynaut is the only baby Pokémon that cannot be found in the wild.
* Wynaut is one of the few [[Generation III]] Pokémon who made a debut before the {{series|Advanced Generation}}.
* Wynaut has the lowest base {{stat|Special Attack}} of all {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Like its evolution, {{p|Wobbuffet}}, Wynaut is probably based on an {{wp|Okiagari-koboshi}} doll, a Japanese traditional doll with squinted eyes that stands back upright when pushed over. It is a symbol of perseverance.

====Name origin====
Wynaut is a play on the phrase, "Why not?"

Apart from a difference in tone, Sohnano is nearly homophonous with the phrase そうなの ''sō na no'', which means, "Really?" or "Is that so?" It is played off by its evolution, {{p|Wobbuffet}}, whose Japanese name of Sonans is homophonous with the interjection そうなんす ''sō na-n-su'', which roughly means, "That's the way it is." Together, they make for a potential perpetual conversation of, "Really?" followed by, "That's the way it is," and so on, as seen in ''[[PK11|Camp Pikachu]]''.

Other languages' names for the Pokémon in this family, due to the fact that they were introduced in different generations, do not feature this pun.

==In other languages==
