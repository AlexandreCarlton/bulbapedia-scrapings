'''Beedrill''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''スピアー''' ''Spear'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Kakuna}} starting at [[level]] 10. It is the final form of {{p|Weedle}}. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Beedrill''' using the [[Beedrillite]].

==Biology==
Beedrill mostly resembles a bipedal, yellow wasp; however, it only has four legs instead of six and lacks {{wp|pigment pits}}. Beedrill's head is round with a slightly pointed mouth, large, red eyes, and black antennae with a sharp bend in the middle. Its forelegs are tipped with long, conical stingers. It stands on its other two legs, which are long, segmented, and insectoid in shape. Beedrill has two pairs of rounded, veined wings, and another stinger on its yellow-and-black striped abdomen.

As Mega Beedrill, its gains more defined features. The antennae are shorter and now extent forward and back over its head. Its eyes become longer and sleeker. It now has three pairs of wings; the uppermost pair is larger with a black trim along the top. Its stingers become longer and larger, resembling javelins. Its legs are no longer insectoid, and instead resemble conical, black-and-yellow stingers with white tips. Its abdomen becomes larger and grooved, and is attached to its thorax by a black structure. A similar black structure connects its head and thorax. The stinger on its abdomen is now a pale yellow, and it now has black stripes over its entire body. Fast-acting poison is stored in the stingers on its limbs, while the tail stinger produces a slow-acting poison that is used to finish opponents. The instantaneous poisons are instead used to prevent the foe from fleeing.<ref name= "Mega">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-beedrill</ref>

Beedrill is highly territorial and normally lives in colonies. As seen in [[EP004|the anime]], Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare of {{p|Weedle}} and {{p|Kakuna}}, and it will respond aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing a swarm of Beedrill will cause the whole colony to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. The two stingers on its forelimbs allow it to use its former [[signature move]], {{m|Twineedle}}. It will take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}} and misty wooded areas.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Casey's Beedrill]]=====
Ash captured a Beedrill in the [[Bug-Catching Contest]], but he gave it to {{an|Casey}} because she is a huge fan of yellow and black Pokémon. Multiple Beedrill also appeared in the same episode.

=====Other=====
Beedrill's first non-cameo appearance was in ''[[EP004|Challenge of the Samurai]]'', where a swarm of them stole [[Ash's Metapod]] after evolving from {{p|Kakuna}}. The reason for this was to avenge Ash for failing to capture the {{p|Weedle}} (and startling it), which subsequently fled after Samurai arrived. The Beedrill reappeared in a flashback in ''[[EP015|Battle Aboard the St. Anne]]''.

In ''[[EP077|The Fourth Round Rumble]]'' a Trainer named [[Jeanette Fisher]] used a Beedrill in her battle against Ash; it battled {{AP|Bulbasaur}} but was defeated. It reappeared in a flashback in ''[[EP080|Friends to the End]]''.

Two of them appeared again in ''[[XY139|Facing the Needs of the Many!]]'', and then three of them appeared in the [[XY140|following episode]].

Three Beedrill appeared in ''[[XY104|A Windswept Encounter!]]'' as the followers of a wild male {{p|Breloom}} that was in love with an Orange Flower {{p|Floette}}.

==Trivia==
* Beedrill's English name was [[Pokémon Red and Green beta#Pokémon names|originally]] going to be spelled ''Beedril''.
* Beedrill's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 2 Attack and 1 Special Defense is unique.
* Beedrill can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Butterfree}}. Both of their unevolved stages evolve into their respective first evolutionary stages at level 7, which then evolve into their respective final forms at level 10. They both also go through metamorphosis-like evolution and share a base stat total of 395. Also, while Beedrill is a version exclusive of Black and Black 2, Butterfree is exclusive to White and White 2.
* In [[Pokémon Conquest]], Beedrill is the only Pokémon that is featured without its evolutionary relatives.
* Mega Beedrill<!--not Beedrill--> was designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/548085137955508224]</ref>
* Mega Beedrill has the highest {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Speed}} base stats of all {{type|Poison}} Pokémon. It also has the lowest {{stat|Special Attack}} base stat of all Poison-type and Mega Evolved Pokémon, the lowest {{stat|Defense}} of all Mega Evolved Pokémon, and the lowest single base stat of any Mega Evolved Pokémon.

===Origin===
Its design appears to simply be a stylized bee or {{wp|wasp}}. However, it has a much closer resemblance to an {{wp|Asian giant hornet}}. Its {{shiny}} form may be based on the ''{{wp|Agapostemon}}'', as both are green in color.

====Name origin====
Beedrill is a combination of ''{{wp|bee}}'' and ''{{wp|drill}}'' (indicating its needle-like arms).

Spear refers to its stingers. In addition, the reverse of スピアー is アピス ''Apis'' (the genus for the {{wp|honey bee}}).
