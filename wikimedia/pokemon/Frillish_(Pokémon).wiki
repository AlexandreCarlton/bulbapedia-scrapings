'''Frillish''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''プルリル''' ''Pururill'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Ghost}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Jellicent}} starting at [[level]] 40.

==Biology==
Frillish is a jellyfish-like Pokémon resembling young royalty. Regardless of gender, it has a round head with a crown-like tuft, and five tentacle-like appendages. It has oval eyes with white pupils, and a collar around its neck. It has invisible poison spikes on its appendages. As a male Frillish, it is blue, with smooth appendages and a triangular crown. It has red eyes with blue sclera and a straight eyelash on each eye, its collar is wavy, and it appears to be frowning. As a female Frillish, it is pink, with wavy appendages and a round crown. It has blue eyes with red sclera and a curled eyelash on each eye, its collar is frilled, and it appears to be smiling.

Frillish is a {{wp|Hadal zone|hadopelagic}} Pokémon which lives in dens about 5 miles (8 kilometers) under the sea surface. Because of this, it can cope with extremely dark and highly pressurized sea conditions. It is carnivorous; it gently floats around in waves until it can strike its prey. It makes its victim numb with the use of its poison spikes and takes it to its deep den.

===Major appearances===
====[[Jessie's Frillish]]====
[[Jessie]] owns a female Frillish, which debuted in ''[[BW109|New Places... Familiar Faces!]]''. Jessie eventually had to give Frillish to {{an|Giovanni}} as a sign that they accomplished something in Unova.

====Other====
A male Frillish appeared in ''[[BW010|A Rival Battle for Club Champ!]]'', under [[Trip]]'s ownership. He used Frillish in his match against {{Ash}}, and it was able to defeat both {{AP|Pidove}} and {{AP|Snivy}}, despite having a disadvantage against the latter in both type and gender.

A female Frillish appeared in ''[[BW037|A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition!]]''. She took a liking to {{Ash}} after he fell into the canal. She was later hooked by {{an|Bianca}} during the fishing competition, and when she saw {{an|Team Rocket}} attempting to kidnap the prize Pokémon, she released them all back into the wild.

Both male and female Frillish appeared in ''[[BW115|The Pokémon Harbor Patrol!]]'', under the ownership of [[Halsey]]. They were used to help rescue people from fires, and then to help put out the fires alongside {{p|Dewott}}.

===Minor appearances===
Both male and female Frillish appeared in the opening sequences of ''[[M14|White—Victini and Zekrom and Black—Victini and Reshiram]]''; the female Frillish was exclusive to the former movie and the male Frillish was exclusive to the latter.

Both male and female Frillish made a cameo appearance in ''[[BW069|Climbing the Tower of Success!]]''.

Both male and female Frillish made a cameo appearance in ''[[BW099|A Surface to Air Tag Battle Team!]].''

A female Frillish appeared in ''[[BW080|Clash of the Connoisseurs!]]''.

A male Frillish appeared in ''[[BW086|Piplup, Pansage, and a Meeting of the Times!]]''.

A female Frillish appeared in [[SM058]]. [[James]] attempted to catch one, but failed when {{TP|James|Mareanie}}, seeing it as a rival for James' affections, scared it off with {{m|Spike Cannon}}.

==Trivia==
* The Japanese [[Pokémon Black and White beta|prototype name]] for Frillish was プルンス ''Purunsu''.<ref>http://imgur.com/lCiPM87</ref>
[[File:592Frillish Female Dream.png|thumb|right|150px|{{pkmn|Dream World}} artwork of female Frillish]]
* Although female {{pkmn|Dream World}} artwork exists, any Frillish or Jellicent uploaded to the {{pkmn|Global Link}} will use the male artwork, regardless of their gender.
* No other Pokémon have the same [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|type combination]] as Frillish and its evolution.

===Origin===
Frillish and its evolution were most likely inspired by the {{wp|Nurarihyon}}, a {{wp|jellyfish}} {{wp|yōkai}} that is either shown as a demonized jellyfish or as a jellyfish-like man who wears refined, sometimes regal, clothing. It is also possible that they was inspired by the Kurage no Hinotama, a type of jellyfish-like {{wp|will-o'-the-wisp}}. Its design is inspired by the jellyfish and {{wp|Victorian fashion|Victorian-style}} monarch attire: the male form's appearance based on a prince's while the female's is based on a princess'. The {{wp|Aurelia aurita|moon jellyfish}} has inspired Frillish in being a ghost type. The two larger arms Frillish possesses are more similar to those of {{wp|squids}} than the tentacles of real jellyfish. Frillish and its evolution also have traits in common with {{wp|sea monsters}} like the {{wp|Kraken}}, most notably their rumored penchant for destroying ships and feeding on the crew.

====Name origin====
Frillish may be a combination of {{wp|Frill (fashion)|''frill''}} and ''jellyfish''.

Pururill may be a combination of プルプル ''purupuru'' (soft) and ''{{wp|rill}}'' or ''{{wp|ruffle|frill}}''.
