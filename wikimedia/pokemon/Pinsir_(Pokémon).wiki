'''Pinsir''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイロス''' ''Kailios'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Pinsir''' using the [[Pinsirite]].

==Biology==
Pinsir is a bipedal Pokémon with a wide, dull brown body and a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally. Its legs are short and thick while its arms are long and thin, and each limb ends with three grey claws. Pinsir's limbs and abdomen are divided into segments. Its eyes are simple, but usually appear angry.

As Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear wings with an area of orange venation. Additionally, a set of wing coverings appear. On each wing cover is a pair of large, thin, orange blades. Its arms become longer and more segmented, with triangular extensions on its lower arms. The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow. When it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement. Mega Pinsir can travel up to 30&nbsp;mph and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them.

It can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents, lift things twice its weight, and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns, and will not be released until they are torn in half. In addition to hunting prey, [[EP119|the anime]] has shown that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forest}}, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile.

In [[Alola]], it has a rivalry with {{p|Vikavolt}} and gets along with {{p|Heracross}}.

==Trivia==
* Pinsir can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Scyther}}. Both are {{type|Bug}} {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}}. Pinsir is exclusive to {{game3|Red and Blue|Blue|s}}, {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|LeafGreen|s}}, and {{game3|Diamond and Pearl|Pearl|s}}, while Scyther is exclusive to Red, FireRed, and Diamond.
** Pinsir can also be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Heracross}}. Both are Bug-type Pokémon based on beetles and lack an evolutionary family. Pinsir is not part {{t|Fighting}} like Heracross, but it learns several Fighting-type moves by leveling up. Both Pokémon and their [[Mega Stone]]s are version exclusives in {{g|X and Y}}: Pinsir and Pinsirite are exclusive to X while Heracross and Heracronite are exclusive to Y. Each Mega Stone can be found in [[Santalune Forest]] in its respective version. The heights of both Pokémon are the same, even when Mega Evolved.
* Mega Pinsir is tied with {{p|Heracross|Mega Heracross}}, {{p|Scizor|Mega Scizor}} and {{p|Genesect}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
* Pinsir shares its category with {{p|Vikavolt}}. They are both known as the Stag Beetle Pokémon.
* Pinsir, along with {{p|Scyther}} and {{p|Scizor}}, are the only Pokémon legitimately available in all 27 in-game [[Poké Ball]] variants.
* Prior to Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Mega Pinsir had the same [[List of Pokémon by body style|body style]] as when it is not Mega Evolved.

===Origin===
It is based on a {{wp|stag beetle}}, possibly ''{{wp|Prosopocoilus inclinatus}}'', a species commonly used in {{wp|insect fighting}}. Its thornlike mandibles most closely resemble that of ''{{wp|Lucanus maculifemoratus}} hopei'', whereas its Mega Evolution's diagonal spikes resemble ''Calcodes versicolor''.

====Name origin====
Pinsir is a corruption of ''pincer'', referring to its horns.

Kailios may be a combination of the Greek letter ''{{wp|Chi (letter)|Χ}}'' (カイ ''kai'') and ''cross'' (referring to its {{m|X-Scissor|scissor-like horns}}). Alternatively, it may be a combination of 傀 ''kai'' (large), 魁偉 ''kaii'' (brawny), or 刈 ''kai'' (cut) combined with κοριός ''korios'' ({{wp|Greek language|Greek}} for ''bug'').
