'''Moltres''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ファイヤー''' ''Fire'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Zapdos}}, it is one of the three [[Legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]].

==Biology==
Moltres is a large, avian Pokémon with orange or golden plumage. It has a long, flowing head crest and a billowing tail, both made of flames. Additionally, its wings are also shrouded in fiery plumage. Its straight, pointed beak is brown, as are its {{wp|Bird anatomy|anisodactyl}} feet. It has short talons.

Moltres sheds embers with every flap of its wings, creating a brilliant flash of flames. By dipping itself into the magma of an active volcano, this Pokémon can heal itself. It migrates to the south with the coming of spring, and is said to bring an early springtime to cold lands. Moltres is {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rarely seen}} by Trainers.

''As tradition has it, the onset of spring heralds the return of this legendary Pokémon from its southern home.

=====Brawl=====
''"A Flame Pokémon. It's one of the legendary bird Pokémon. When Moltres appears in a town, it is said that spring will come earlier there than in other towns. If Moltres is injured, it apparently returns to a volcano to heal its wings with magma. Moltres spreads its wide, flame-covered wings and attacks opponents with the exciting and highly damaging {{m|Sky Attack}}."''

It will use Fly when called into a Smash Bros. battle, flapping its orange wings and sending fire out around it. Getting hit hurts and could launch you so far, you'd make Moltres jealous. That isn't a good thing...''

'''PAL''': ''Moltres is one of the three Legendary Bird Pokémon of the Kanto region, along with Articuno and Zapdos. When spreading its huge wings and taking flight, it can make the flames all over its body burn even brighter. If you get hit by those flames during its Fly attack, you might go flying even further than Moltres! ''

==Trivia==
* Moltres shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Charmeleon}}, {{p|Charizard}}, {{p|Flareon}}, and {{p|Infernape}}. They are all known as the Flame Pokémon.

===Origin===
Moltres may be based on legends of {{wp|Firebird#Folklore|firebird}}s such as the {{wp|phoenix}}, the {{wp|Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Slavic firebird}}, or the {{wp|Bennu}}. It may also be based on the Japanese mythical bird known as 朱雀 ''{{wp|Vermilion Bird|Suzaku}}'', guardian of the South, which is not a true phoenix. It may also be based on a {{wp|heron}}, because of their similarities in shape.

===Name origin===
Moltres is a combination of ''molten'' and ''tres'' ({{wp|Spanish language|Spanish}} for ''three'', indicating that it is the third in the series of [[Kanto]] [[Legendary birds]]). It may also derive from ''{{wp|Molting#Birds|molt}}''.

Fire is literally ''fire''.
