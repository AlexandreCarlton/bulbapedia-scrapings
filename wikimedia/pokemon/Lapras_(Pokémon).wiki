'''Lapras''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラプラス''' ''Laplace'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Ice}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
[[File:Lapras aging.png|thumb|left|Comparison between Lapras's younger and older appearances]]
Lapras is a large sea creature that resembles a {{wp|plesiosaur}}. It has a spotted, blue hide with a cream underside. Its neck is long, and it has large black eyes. There is a short horn in the middle of its forehead and curled ears placed farther back on its head. It has four flippers with the foremost pair being larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.

Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. This docility has made it an easy target for hunters, who have once nearly driven it to extinction; however, it has become overabundant in number due to recent efforts to protect its population. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. It has [[EP113|been known]] to travel the seas in large pods. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In [[Holiday Hi-Jynx|the anime]] it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy. Lapras is native to {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|the seas}}.

{{spoilers}}
The most notable role of Lapras in [[Pokémon Adventures]] was being one of the Pokémon of [[Pryce]]. In his youth, Pryce lost two of his favorite Lapras, La Pris and La Prus, in an avalanche just as the {{pkmn|Egg}} borne by them hatched. Unable to get over his loss, Pryce swore to save his Lapras and thus began researching into time travel, setting the events of the [[Johto]] saga in motion. Eventually, Pryce was able to capture {{p|Celebi}} and enter time, only to lose Celebi as the [[Poké Ball]] containing it was shattered, causing him to be unable to override time any further. However, the baby Lapras, La Glace, was able to enter the time in which Pryce's Lapras were separated, and the family enjoyed a happy reunion while Pryce was eventually lost in time. The child Lapras first appeared in ''[[PS143|Irked Igglybuff and Curmudgeonly Cleffa]]'' and the parents appeared in ''[[PS180|The Last Battle XIV]]''.
{{endspoilers}}

Another Lapras appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to help the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

[[Iris]] was seen with a Lapras in ''[[PS516|One Way or Another]]''.

{{adv|Sun}} uses a [[Ride Pokémon]] Lapras to transport him through water. It first appeared in [[PASM09]].

===In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga===
[[File:Ash Lapras EToP.png|thumb|150px|Lapras in the [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]]]
{{main|Ash's Lapras}}
In [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]], Ash saves a Lapras from a swarm of {{p|Krabby}} tormenting it. Like in the {{pkmn|anime}}, Ash used this Lapras as a mode of transportation through the [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]] saga. It is not known in this version if he releases it. Misty also uses one as a mode of transportation.

===In the Pokémon Zensho manga===
{{Zensho|Satoshi}} has a Lapras which originally belonged to Sabrina and was given to him after trying to defeat Giovanni.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}} and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky|Explorers of Sky]]: Lapras is the Pokémon that ferries Pokémon to the [[Hidden Land]]. When {{mdc|Wigglytuff|2}} explored the [[Brine Cave]] and found the strange marking on the wall there, Lapras asked Wigglytuff not to investigate it further to keep the Hidden Land a secret. During the player's exploration of Brine Cave, the partner's Relic Fragment resonates with a painting in the deepest part of the cave, and this summons Lapras. Lapras ferries the player, the partner, and Grovyle to the Hidden Land, along the way telling the story of what happened when Wigglytuff and {{mdc|Chatot|2}} came to Brine Cave. Later, after the player defeats Dialga at Temporal Tower, Lapras will be waiting at the beach and can ferry the player and the partner back to the Hidden Land again. There is no limit to how many times Lapras can do this.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Lapras runs the [[Lapras Travel Liner]], which allows the player to visit other continents in the [[Pokémon world (Mystery Dungeon)|world]].

==Trivia==
[[File:131Lapras RB.png|thumb|130px|Lapras shown with teeth in its Generation I artwork.]]
[[File:Photo Spot Azure Bay.png|thumb|200px|Riding on Lapras in [[Azure Bay]]]]
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Lapras was originally going to be called "Ness", a reference to the {{wp|Loch Ness Monster}}.
* Lapras was depicted with teeth in its [[Generation I]] official artwork and in [[Pokémon Adventures]].
* Lapras has the highest base {{stat|HP}} of all {{type|Ice}} Pokémon.
* Lapras is one of two Pokémon to use telepathy to speak to humans in a regular episode of the anime. The other is {{p|Ralts}}.
* Lapras is one of [[Veronica Taylor]]'s favorite Pokémon.
* In [[Pokémon X and Y]], Lapras has a unique 3D model when {{m|surf}}ing, whereas all other surfing Pokémon are depicted as dark blobs. This may be an homage to the [[Generation II]] surfing sprites ( [[File:GSC Surf M.png]] [[File:C Surf F.png]] ), which greatly resemble Lapras, or Lapras's role as a means of transport.
** A Shiny Lapras uses the same 3D model as a regular one while surfing.
** In [[Photography#Pokémon X and Y|photos]] taken at [[Azure Bay]], the player is seen riding a Lapras even if no Lapras is in the party.
*Lapras can learn the most [[one-hit knockout move]]s of any Pokémon (excluding {{p|Smeargle}}), being able to learn {{m|Sheer Cold}}, {{m|Fissure}}, and {{m|Horn Drill}}.

===Origin===
Lapras is based on the fabled {{wp|Loch Ness Monster}} in {{wp|Scotland}}. The creature and this Pokémon resemble an extinct order of marine reptiles known as {{wp|Plesiosauria}}. Lapras's shell and horn may be inspired by {{wp|placodont}}s. Its intelligence, singing, and rarity can be comparable to some {{wp|cetacea}}ns, especially {{wp|blue whale}}s and {{wp|humpback whale}}s. Its long neck and robust body may also be inspired by the mast heads and hulls of {{wp|Viking}} ships.

====Name origin====
Lapras is a corruption of Laplace.

Laplace may be a reference to {{wp|Pierre-Simon Laplace}}, a mathematician who wrote several books on the mathematical properties of the sea and tides. Alternatively, Laplace may be derived from ''la place'' (French for ''seat''), referring to how passengers sit on its back like a seat to be ferried across bodies of water. It may also be derived from {{wp|lapis lazuli}}, a bright blue gem.
