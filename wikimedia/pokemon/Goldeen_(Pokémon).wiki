'''Goldeen''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''トサキント''' ''Tosakinto'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Seaking}} starting at [[level]] 33.

==Biology==
Goldeen is a white, fish-like Pokémon with orange markings on its tail, back, and fins. It has a thin dorsal fin and long pectoral fins. Its dorsal and pectoral fins are quite strong, allowing it to maintain a steady speed of five knots while swimming upstream. Goldeen's caudal fin is admired by many for its beauty as it billows very much like a ballroom dress. Its circular eyes are blue, and it has pink lips. On its forehead is a large horn, which is larger on the male than on the female.

It has a wild temperament, and will use its horn to smash its way to freedom if kept in an aquarium. Humans swimming near it must exercise caution lest Goldeen ram them. Goldeen is a very common sight in any body of {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|fresh water}}, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. It can be seen swimming upstream in large schools during the breeding season in spring.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Goldeen (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:Goldeen SSBB.png|thumb|200px|Goldeen in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
When released from a {{ball|Poké}}, Goldeen will use {{m|Splash}}, having no effect on the battle.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When released from a Poké Ball, Goldeen will use {{m|Splash}}, having no effect on the battle.

Goldeen is also a Pokéfloat. It will appear from the bottom of the screen but quickly drop down to the bottom again, knocking out any character it hits.

====Trophy information====
''These Water-types are often referred to as "water dancers," as their elegant fins make them incredible agile underwater. They can even travel upstream in rapids at a speed of five knots; of course, they're not quite as nimble on dry land. Goldeen's {{m|Horn Drill}} is so strong that it can KO an enemy with one strike if it connects.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
Goldeen will sometimes be found in a Poké Ball and will use {{m|Splash}} when released. It does nothing to affect the battle. On the official blog, Masahiro Sakurai commented that Goldeen appearing at the most critical of times is in keeping with {{wp|Murphy's Law}}.<ref>[http://www.smashbros.com/en_uk/items/mball/mball01.html]</ref>

====Trophy information====
''"A Goldfish Pokémon. In contrast to its elegant appearance, it has a wild temperament, and its attack with its horn is severe. Among the techniques it can master, {{m|Horn Drill}} is especially reliable. It evolves into Seaking, but if raised without evolving, it can learn the powerful {{type|Bug}} {{m|Megahorn}}. There are male and female Goldeen--the male's horn is longer."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Goldeen will sometimes appear from a Poké Ball or even a Master Ball. As in the previous games, it uses Splash when released, having no effect on the battle.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Water-type Pokémon sports a fancy horn on its head. An excellent swimmer, it can literally swim up waterfalls. In the world of Pokémon, this elegant Pokémon has a variety of effective moves in battle. In Smash Bros., however, all it can use is an ineffective Splash attack.''

'''PAL''': ''A Water-type Pokémon with a distinctive horn. Thanks to its powerful fins, Goldeen can swim comfortably through the most torrential waters and even up waterfalls. It's known for both its strength and grace. That said, don't expect it to make a big splash in this game - just a little one when it uses Splash... It's super ineffective!''

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Goldeen was originally known as "Goldy".
* Goldeen, as well as Seaking, has been in all Japan-centric regional [[Pokédex]]es.
* Goldeen's number in the [[List of Pokémon by Sinnoh Pokédex number|Sinnoh Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are the same: 078.
* Goldeen and Seaking are the only two Pokémon that can learn {{m|Waterfall}} through [[level]]-up.
** This also makes them the only Pokémon to learn Waterfall in [[Generation I]], before the move was an [[HM]].
* Goldeen shares a fairly similar in-game cry to {{p|Caterpie}}, being only .07 seconds longer.
* Even though Goldeen uses {{m|Splash}} in all four Super Smash Bros. games, it has no way of learning the move in any Pokémon game.
* Goldeen's [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions|Pokémon SoulSilver]] [[Pokédex]] entry claims it can swim at "5 knots per hour." This is technically incorrect, as {{wp|Knot (unit)|knots}} is already a measure of speed, not distance.

===Origin===
Goldeen is based on a {{wp|goldfish}}. Its horn may be based on {{wp|Matsya}}, an avatar that the {{wp|Hindu deities|Hindu god}} {{wp|Vishnu}} assumed, which is sometimes depicted as a fish with a horn.

====Name origin====
Goldeen may be a combination of ''goldfish'' and ''queen''.

Tosakinto is derived from とさきん ''tosakin'', a kind of goldfish.
