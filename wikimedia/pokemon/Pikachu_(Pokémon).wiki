'''Pikachu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ピカチュウ''' ''Pikachu'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Pichu}} when [[level]]ed up with high [[friendship]] and evolves into {{p|Raichu}} when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]]. However, the [[Red's Pikachu (game)|starter Pikachu]] in {{game|Yellow}} will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.

In [[Alola]], Pikachu will evolve into [[Regional variant|Alolan]] Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.

Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the [[Pokémon]] franchise and a major representative of [[Nintendo]]'s collective mascots.

It is also the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Yellow}}, where it is the only [[starter Pokémon]] in that game. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.

Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in [[Pokémon Rumble Blast]] and [[Pokémon Rumble World]].

==Biology==
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, brown eyes, and two red circles on its cheeks. There are pouches inside its cheeks where it stores electricity. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is patch of brown fur at the base. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.

[[EP039|The anime]] has shown that Pikachu sometimes travel in groups. It raises its tail to check its surroundings, and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups build, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Living in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forested areas}}, Pikachu is found foraging for [[Berry|berries]] it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu|It has been observed]] eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.

Pikachu is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has [[EP030|been known]] to build up energy in its glands, and will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its [[signature move]] {{m|Volt Tackle}}.

Pikachu has two [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Pikachu|alternate forms]]: one, the [[Cosplay Pikachu]], appeared in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five [[Contest conditions]]. The other form is {{DL|Ash's Pikachu|Pikachu in a cap}}, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in [[Generation VII]]. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of {{Ash}}'s [[Ash's hat|hats]] from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other [[Pikachu variants]] have appeared in various media.

Pikachu is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the exclusive [[Z-Move]]s {{m|Catastropika}} and {{m|10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt}}.

=====[[Pikachutwo]]=====
In ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'', {{OBP|Mewtwo|original series}} clones Ash's Pikachu. This Pikachu can be told apart from Ash's due to spikes on the black marks at the tips of its ears. It is also comparatively more aggressive than Ash's Pikachu and slurs its speech, defects possibly caused by Ash tampering with Mewtwo's cloning machine during the cloning process.

=====[[Puka]]=====
Another Pikachu nicknamed [[Puka]] was owned by a man named {{OBP|Victor|EP067}} on [[Seafoam Islands|Seafoam Island]] in ''[[EP067|The Pi-Kahuna]]''. This blue-eyed Pikachu saved Ash from drowning by having the ability to sense tidal waves approaching.

==In the TCG==
[[File:PikachuBaseSet58.png|200px|thumb|Pikachu in the TCG]]
[[File:GBML Bronze Pikachu Coin.png|thumb|100px|left|Pikachu TCG Coin]]
{{main|Pikachu (TCG)}}
Pikachu somehow manages to find its way into many of the expansions, causing there to be {{#expr: {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Pikachu (TCG)}} - 1}} known non-reprint Pokémon cards featuring Pikachu. There are also various Trainer cards with Pikachu in the card's artwork too, including the very sought-after tournament promos such as {{OBP|No.1 Trainer|Tournament promo}}.

The first Pikachu that appeared in the TCG was {{TCG ID|Base Set|Pikachu|58}} in the {{TCG|Base Set}} (which was reprinted in {{TCG|Base Set 2}} and in {{TCG|POP Series 2}} with different artwork). It was followed in {{TCG|Jungle|the next set}} by another {{TCG ID|Jungle|Pikachu|60}} (which was also reprinted in the {{TCG|Legendary Collection}}). The third Pikachu card released was the first-ever English {{TCG|Wizards Black Star Promos|promo card}}, {{TCG ID|Wizards Promo|Pikachu|1}}. The original Base Set Pikachu was also released as a special promotional card at {{wp|E3}}.

In the early days of the TCG, several notable errors were made regarding the Pikachu cards. The Base Set Pikachu was released with altered artwork at first, depicting it with red cheeks, instead of the original yellow. While this matched [[Ken Sugimori]]'s artwork, the yellow color on its cheeks was intentional by the artist, who depicted Pikachu using {{m|ThunderShock}}. This error appeared in both the E3 promotional version and the normal Base Set release. A second error was made in the production of Jungle set booster packs, which, instead of the Jungle set's Pikachu, sometimes contained first edition versions of the Pikachu that was released as a promo card.

Pikachu has also been featured on a number of TCG {{TCG|coin}}s, with one being included with the English and European languages-only {{tcg|Base Set 2}}. This coin was also featured in the {{g|Play It!}} PC game. A Pikachu coin is also featured in the [[Game Boy]] game {{ga|Pokémon Trading Card Game}}, and is one of the coins that can be obtained in {{g|Card GB2: Here Comes Team GR!}}, where it is given by [[Club Master Isaac]] to winners of the [[Lightning Club]].

==In the TFG==
Two Pikachu figures have been released.

Pikachu is a playable character for the arcade fighting game. Its moveset includes electrical attacks it uses in the main games, like {{m|Thunderbolt}}, {{m|Electro Ball}}, and {{m|Thunder}}. In Burst form, it can use the Burst Attack Volt Shock Fist. Several of its attacks and victory poses are directly taken from {{wp|Heihachi Mishima|Heihachi}} and {{wp|Kazuya Mishima}}'s movesets from the ''{{wp|Tekken}}'' series.

''Pikachu overwhelms opponents with powerful electric shocks and quick movements.''<ref>[http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-ca/characters/ Pokkén Tournament's official site]</ref>

==Trivia==
[[File:Niue Dollar Pikachu.jpg|thumb|250px|$1 coin from {{wp|Niue}} featuring Pikachu]]
[[File:Stadium025.png|thumb|Pikachu in Pokémon Stadium]]
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Pikachu as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Pikachu on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.
* Pikachu and its {{p|Raichu|evolved form}} share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Rattata}}, {{p|Raticate}}, {{p|Sandshrew}}, and {{p|Sandslash}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon.
** They all have at least one family member with a [[regional variant]] in Alola.
* [[Veronica Taylor]] has stated that Pikachu is her favorite {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. [[Sarah Natochenny]] has said it was her favorite as well, along with {{p|Mew}}.
* In 2008, Japanese researchers discovered a new protein that helps carry electrical impulses from the eyes to the brain and named it {{wp|pikachurin}}. According to the researchers, the decision was based on both the Pokémon and protein possessing "lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects".
* There have been three Pikachu balloons in the {{wp|Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade}}. The first, known as the "Flying Pikachu" was flown from 2001 through 2005. It was used in a morning rush hour test of wind conditions in {{wp|Times Square}} after an accident involving an {{wp|M&M's}} balloon in the 2005 parade<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/nyregion/23balloon.html?_r=0 Pikachu Soars as Trial Balloon for a Safer Macy's Parade - New York Times]</ref> and made its farewell appearance at the [[Pokémon 10th Anniversary|Party of the Decade]] in August 2006, in New York City's {{wp|Bryant Park}}. The second version debuted in the 2006 parade, features glowing cheeks, and chases a [[Poké Ball]] balloon. The third one, introduced for the 2014 parade, has Pikachu wearing a green scarf and holding a small Pikachu shaped snowman.
* Pikachu is the only [[core series]] [[starter Pokémon]] with a pre-evolved form, though {{p|Pichu}} was not available in {{game|Yellow}}.
* Pikachu is the only core series starter Pokémon that is not {{t|Fire}}, {{t|Water}}, or {{t|Grass}}-type.
* According to ''[[A Sneak Peek at Pokémon]]'', Pikachu can deliver a constant current of 1000 {{wp|ampere}}s.
* Pikachu has the most [[event Pokémon|event]]-exclusive [[move]]s available to it.
* In the Japanese {{jap|Pokémon Stadium}}, Pikachu is the only Pokémon that can be used in battle that is not fully [[evolved]].
* In {{game|Yellow}}, and beginning in [[Generation VI]] onwards, Pikachu uses its [[cry]] from the {{pkmn|anime}} as voiced by [[Ikue Ohtani]]. Pikachu is the only Pokémon that uses its anime voice in any core series game.
* In all of these games, Pikachu's cry upon entering the field is not the same cry played in its status or Pokédex screens.
** If the {{ga|Red's Pikachu|starter Pikachu}} from Yellow is transferred to {{eng|Pokémon Stadium}} or {{pkmn|Stadium 2}}, it will also use its anime voice.
* {{4v|Black|White}} are the only core series, handheld games in which Pikachu is not available in some way, although it makes a number of cameo appearances including as an NPC.
* Pikachu was the focus of a {{OBP|Pokémon Center|store}} [[Sleeping Pikachu Collection|collection]] in June 2014.
* Of all the Pokémon that were given increased [[base stats]] in [[Generation VI]], Pikachu is the only one that received an increase to more than one stat: its Defense and Special Defense. It is also the only one that is not fully evolved.
* Pikachu is the only Pokémon that can be caught in all three pinball titles: [[Pokémon Pinball]], [[Pokémon Pinball mini]], and [[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire]].
* Pikachu's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Alola Pokédex number|Alola Pokédex]] are the same: 025.

===Origin===
Pikachu has physical aspects of several species of {{wp|rodent}}s, and its {{pkmn|category}} suggests that it is based on a {{wp|mouse}}. Its long ears resemble members of {{wp|Lagomorpha}}.

Pikachu was designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]], a member of the core design team at Game Freak.<ref>[http://www.natsume.com/news/news_pdffiles/pid_129_HSBigNames0806.pdf Natsume: THE TALENT BEHIND HOMETOWN STORY]</ref>

====Name origin====
Pikachu is a combination of ピカピカ ''pikapika'' (onomatopoeia for sparkle) and チューチュー ''chūchū'' (the sound of squeaking).<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html TIME - The Ultimate Game Freak]</ref>
