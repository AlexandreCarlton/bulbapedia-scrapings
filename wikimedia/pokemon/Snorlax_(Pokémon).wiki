'''Snorlax''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カビゴン''' ''Kabigon'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Munchlax}} when [[level]]ed up with high [[friendship]].

In the [[Generation I]] and {{gen|II}} games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout [[Kanto]]. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a [[Poké Flute]] or [[Pokégear]] set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in [[Pokémon X and Y]], in which it is blocking the player's way on {{rt|7|Kalos}}.

==Biology==
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, where most of its fat reserves accumulate. Its head is large, with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has large, hind feet with three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and its arms and five foreclaws are short.

Snorlax is often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains and forests}}. It wakes up only to eat and seldom for exercises. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects, even being able to handle {{p|Muk}}'s poison. When hungry, it is not satisfied until it consumes 900&nbsp;lbs. (400&nbsp;kg) of food, and can eat in its sleep. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.

Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted serious effort. It is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the exclusive [[Z-Move]] {{m|Pulverizing Pancake}}.

==Other appearances==
[[File:Snorlax SSBB.png|thumb|200px|Snorlax in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]

===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
When released from a Poké Ball, Snorlax will ascend into the air before descending over a large area of the screen with a {{m|Body Slam}} that sends any opponent underneath flying.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Snorlax does the same maneuver as it did in the previous game, but covers a smaller area.

Snorlax is also a [[Poké Floats|Poké Float]]. It is lying down asleep and so fighting occurs on its head and belly.
====Melee trophy information====
''Snorlax love to sleep and love to eat: these portly Pokémon get grumpy if they don't get 888 pounds of food per day. After snacking out, they always nap. They have cast-iron stomachs and can eat moldy and even rotten food with no digestion problems. They are the heaviest Pokémon on record, weighing in at over 1,000 pounds.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
Snorlax once again performs the same maneuver as the previous games.

====Brawl trophy information====

''"A Sleeping Pokémon. It's the ultimate loafer. Sometimes children like to play on top its big belly. Once in a slumber, not even the hardest rain or the fiercest wind will wake it. Snorlax recovers health and restores its physical state by sleeping, and it proves daunting with its damaging {{m|Snore}} attack. Snorlax is the king of Sleeping Pokémon."''
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
[[File:Snorlax SSB4.png|thumb|240px|Snorlax in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.]]
Snorlax reappears as a Poké Ball summon in these games, behaving the same way as before.
====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This sleepy, Normal-type Pokémon is huge! It eats more than 900 lb. of food every day. Most of the time not spent eating is spent sleeping. That big, round body comes in handy when it's brought onto a Smash Bros. battlefield—the Body Slam attack will send anyone who gets hit flying into the air!''

'''PAL''': ''Snorlax is often referred to as the Sleeping Pokémon, and there's a good reason for that! This giant loafer spends almost all its time snoozing, getting up for just long enough each day to scoff up a tidy 400kg of food. In this game, it soars into the air and uses its Body Slam attack, smacking into fighters like a giant wrecking ball.''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}}: Snorlax will be seen sleeping throughout the game, effectively cutting off certain areas until later on. It will eventually remain in a cave in the [[Sekra Range]]. Once the rest of the [[List of Pokémon by Fiore Browser number|Ranger Browser]] has been completed, it will wake up and can be captured.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Stadium series]] (and later 3D games), Snorlax open their eyes when they faint.
* In [[Pokémon Snap]], Snorlax stands up and dances to the music when the [[Poké Flute]] is used.
* In {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, if the player interacts with a Snorlax that is {{pkmn2|walking}} with them while at [[Mt. Silver]], the message "SNORLAX is feeling very eager" will appear. This is due to {{ga|Red}}, who is also at Mt. Silver, owning a Snorlax as well. While the player is on Mt. Silver, unique messages will also appear if the player interacts with a walking {{p|Pikachu}} or {{p|Charizard}}.
* Snorlax has the highest base stat total of all Pokémon that can hatch from an {{pkmn|Egg}}.
* In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Snorlax is programmed to be able to learn {{m|Charm}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, but no other Pokémon in the {{egg2|Monster}} can legitimately learn it to pass down as an [[Egg Move]] in those games. In [[Generation III]] on, Snorlax can inherit the move from {{p|Bulbasaur}} by chain breeding.
* Snorlax is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Snorlax may be loosely based on {{wp|hibernation|hibernating}} {{wp|bear}}s or {{wp|teddy bear}}s. It may also be based on the {{wp|cave bear}}. It may also be based on a food coma, as it eats large quantities of food, then takes a nap (symptoms of a food coma). Snorlax also shares traits with {{wp|sloth}}s, who are often portrayed as lazy and sleepy creatures.

====Name origin====
Snorlax is a combination of ''snore'' and ''lax'' or ''relax''.

Kabigon may come from an alternate reading of sleep, 寐 ''bi'', and a corruption of 鼾酔 ''kansui'' (snoring) or 憩う ''ikou'' (rest). It may also incorporate 黴 ''kabi'' (mold), noting the fact that Snorlax will eat anything, even moldy food. Kabigon is also based on the nickname of [[Game Freak]] programmer [[Kōji Nishino]], which is the reason his game appearance uses Snorlax as his highest-leveled Pokémon in {{2v2|Black|White|2}}.
