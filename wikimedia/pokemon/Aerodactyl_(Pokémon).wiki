'''Aerodactyl''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''プテラ''' ''Ptera'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Flying}} [[Fossil]] {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is resurrected from an [[Old Amber]], and while is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Aerodactyl''' using the [[Aerodactylite]].

==Biology==
Aerodactyl is a reptilian, bipedal Pokémon with large, membranous wings. It has sharply pointed ears and a fierce expression with intense eyes. Its snout is ridged, with a gaping mouth and strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light violet-gray skin with violet wings. Aerodactyl's wings consist of a membrane running from the side of the body to the tip of an elongated finger. The clawed hands at the bend of each wing allow it to grasp objects. A hump-like ridge grows from its back and it has a strong, arrow-tipped tail. Its talon-like feet are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.

When Aerodactyl Mega Evolves, its body begins to turn to stone, which was its original appearance before fossilization.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Aerodactyl</ref> It grows larger in size and sprouts jagged black spikes all over its body. There are five spikes at the wrist joint of each wing, replacing its hands. Three small spikes grow along the tail, and the spine on its back has become large and stony. The rear talons of the feet have also turned black. Its chin and ears are each decorated with a large spike, with rocky plates marking its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small marks flanking a longer mark. Its eyes have changed to a dark green color. 

Due to the sharp appearance of Aerodactyl's fangs, it was originally thought to be exclusively a {{wp|carnivore}}. However, [[SS015|the anime]] shows it joyfully consuming fruit. Its serrated fangs and ferocious attitude are nevertheless very imposing, and it is said to be capable of effortlessly ripping out enemies' throats. With its impressive wings, Aerodactyl fearlessly soars high in the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However its walk was weak and slow when it touched ground. When at rest it enjoys the safety and seclusion of the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|mountains}} where it likes to nest. Aerodactyl is extant using Fossil revitalization, but is considered extinct in the wild. When it Mega Evolves, Mega Aerodactyl becomes even more vicious and irritable than it was before. This is because [[Mega Evolution]] is a burden on its body.

====Major appearances====
Aerodactyl debuted in ''[[EP046|Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon]]''. It scared off the other [[Generation I]] Fossil Pokémon that were chasing {{Ash}} and {{TRT}}.

An Aerodactyl appeared in ''[[SS015|Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl!]]'', where it was revived by [[Gary Oak]].

==Trivia==
* Aerodactyl was [[List of references to Pokémon in popular culture|the inspiration for the naming]] of ''{{wp|Aerodactylus}}'', a genus of pterosaurs.
* Aerodactyl is the only Fossil Pokémon that does not have an evolution or pre-evolution, and it is the only one with a [[Mega Evolution]].
** It is also the only Fossil Pokémon that can be obtained in any way other than breeding, reviving its Fossil or from the {{pkmn|Dream World}}: it is available through an [[in-game trade]] in [[Generation II]], as a gift in [[Generation VII]], and is one of [[Hayley's trades]].
*** The trade in [[Generation II]] was removed in {{2v|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, likely due to the fact that the [[Old Amber]] could be obtained and revived in these games, unlike in Generation II.
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Aerodactyl was originally known as "Ptera", its Japanese name.
* Mega Aerodactyl has the highest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all {{type|Rock}} Pokémon.
* Mega Aerodactyl has the highest base stat total of all Fossil Pokémon.
* During its first appearance in ''[[EP046|Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon]]'', it was implied that Aerodactyl was carnivorous, based on its teeth (and the reactions of the other Fossil Pokémon when it arrived). However, in ''[[SS015|Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl!]]'', it is shown and proven to be at least omnivorous, based on its joyful consumption of fruit.
* Aerodactyl is one of four non-Hoenn Dex Pokémon available in [[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire]]. The others are {{p|Chikorita}}, {{p|Cyndaquil}} and {{p|Totodile}}.
* Mega Aerodactyl has a unique base stat total of 615.

===Origin===
Aerodactyl's design is mostly based on {{wp|Rhamphorhynchidae|rhamphorhynchids}}, a family of toothed pterosaurs. However, its pointed wings, spaded tail, and robust jaws also make it resemble a {{wp|Dragon|dragon}}, specifically {{wp|Wyvern|wyverns}}.

====Name origin====
Aerodactyl's name is a combination of ''aero'' ({{wp|Greek language|Greek}} for ''air'') and ''{{wp|pterodactyl}}''.

Ptera's name derives from ''{{wp|pterosaur}}''.
