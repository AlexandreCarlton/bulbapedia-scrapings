'''Dialga''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ディアルガ''' ''Dialga'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Dialga is the [[game mascot]] of {{game3|Diamond and Pearl|Pokémon Diamond|s}}, appearing on the boxart.

Along with {{p|Palkia}} and {{p|Giratina}}, it is a member of the [[creation trio]] of [[Sinnoh]], representing time.

==Biology==
Dialga is a dark blue {{wp|sauropod}}-like Pokémon with some gray metallic portions, such as its chestplate, which has a diamond in the center. It also has various light blue stripes. It has a fin-like structure on its back and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. Dialga also has two horns on top of its head, two fang-like horns around its mouth, and three spines on the back of its neck. It has three claws on each foot of the same metallic looks as its chestplate. Faint cracks exist across its body. The wing-like structure on its back can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Explorers of Time, Darkness]], and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Sky]].

Dialga can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, or stopping it altogether. As Dialga primarily resides in a [[Dimensions|different dimension]], its behavior is nearly impossible to study. It has been shown to be very protective of its home. It also tends to have violent conflicts with its counterpart, {{p|Palkia}}. Dialga is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] that can learn {{m|Roar of Time}}.

==In the anime==

===In the main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Dialga (movie)]]=====
Dialga made its physical debut in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', where it fought with {{mov|Palkia}} and {{mov|Darkrai|Darkrai|10}} in a battle that nearly destroyed [[Alamos Town]]. It then briefly reappeared in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. During its trip back to its own dimension, Dialga ended up in the [[Reverse World]] and got attacked by {{mov|Giratina}}, who had been angered by Dialga and Palkia's fight in the previous movie.

Dialga's final movie appearance was in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', where it was shown for the first time with both the other members of [[Creation trio|its trio]]. After being called by [[Sheena]] to stop a spatial distortion, it briefly fought with Giratina once more. Later, it returned to help Palkia and Giratina fight {{mov|Arceus|Arceus|12}}. After being injured, it sent Sheena, {{Ash}}, and {{ashfr}} back in time to fix Arceus's betrayal.

[[File:Primal Dialga anime.png|thumb|left|220px|Primal Dialga in the anime]]

=====[[Primal Dialga]]=====
Primal Dialga made two brief appearances in ''[[SS021|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky - Beyond Time & Darkness]]'' as the protector of the [[Time Gear]]s.

=====Other=====

Dialga appeared in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'' as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Dialga and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Dialga departed for its home.

==In the manga==
[[File:Dialga Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Dialga in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
[[File:Primal Dialga BET.png|thumb|200px|Primal Dialga in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blazing Exploration Team]]]]
===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Dialga (movie)}}
Dialga first appeared in ''{{ma|The Rise of Darkrai}}'' where it was fighting with {{mov|Palkia}}.

In the [[Arceus and the Jewel of Life (manga)|twelfth movie manga adaption]], Dialga, along with the members of its trio, was summoned by [[Sheena]] to help Ash and his friends. Dialga, {{p|Palkia}}, {{p|Giratina}} battle Arceus and it soon puts Sheena and the others in the past to uncover the betrayal Sheena's ancestor made.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Creation trio (Adventures)}}
Dialga, along with Palkia, was summoned by [[Cyrus]] in the {{chap|Diamond & Pearl}} in order to create a new world. Cyrus used the Red Chains to force Dialga and Palkia to fight each other in order to distort time and space and create a portal that would swallow the existing world. {{adv|Diamond}}, {{adv|Pearl}} and {{adv|Platinum}} worked together with their Pokémon to free Dialga and Palkia from their controlled states. It first appeared in ''[[PS410|Creeping Away from Cradily]]''.

Later on, an accident with handling [[Charon]]'s machine caused Dialga, Palkia and Cyrus to be dragged into the portal before it closed completely. In the {{chap|Platinum}}, it was revealed that {{p|Giratina}} imprisoned both Dialga and Palkia in the [[Distortion World]] before setting off into the current dimension to wreak havoc. Soon, Cyrus and Diamond met in the Distortion World, and agreed to free Dialga and Palkia using their Pokémon. Dialga and Palkia later resumed their struggle against Giratina in the Distortion World. When Charon decided to escape from the Distortion World on Giratina, Diamond got on Dialga and chased after him. Giratina was eventually defeated, with Dialga and Palkia forcing it back into the Distortion World for good, before both returned to the Spear Pillar.

In the {{chap|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}, Dialga was created in the [[Sinjoh Ruins]], along with Palkia and Giratina, by {{p|Arceus}}' creation process, which was forced by [[Team Rocket]]'s [[Executive (Trainer class)|Four Generals]]. Knowing that the creation process would threaten the [[Johto]] region, Team Rocket's true leader {{adv|Giovanni}} returned with [[Lance]] and [[Pryce]] to keep the creation trio at bay while {{adv|Gold}} tried to calm Arceus down. Dialga was kept at bay by Pryce and his {{p|Swinub}}. Once Arceus was eventually becalmed, Dialga and Palkia departed from Johto and were spotted by [[Cynthia]].

===In the Pokémon Battrio: Aim to be Battrio Master! manga===
A Dialga appeared in [[ABM02]] under the ownership of [[Manabu Kazuo]].

===In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure! manga===
In [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!]], [[Hareta]] and [[Mitsumi]] set out on a journey with the intention of finding the god-like Pokémon, Dialga. In ''[[DPA20|The Advent of the Legendary Pokémon!!]]'' [[Cyrus]] successfully controlled Dialga after he gained control of the Red Chain. When Hareta tried to snap Dialga out of Cyrus's control, it was able to flee from Cyrus.

===In the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blazing Exploration Team manga===
{{main|Primal Dialga}}
A Dialga with a darker color appeared in [[BET3]].

===In the Pocket Monsters Platinum: Aim to Be Battle King!! manga===

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
Dialga appeared in [[PMDP29]] of {{OBP|Pocket Monsters DP|Kosaku Anakubo}}.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Dialga (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:SSBBSpearPillarDialga.png|thumb|Dialga on the {{St|Spear Pillar}}]]
Dialga appears as a stage Pokémon along with {{p|Palkia}}, {{p|Cresselia}}, and the [[lake guardians]] on the stage {{St|Spear Pillar}}. It affects the stage much differently than that of its counterpart, such as slowing down time, and even going off its post to attack the players in the middle. It can also distort the stage, like Palkia, but only slightly and not as extreme, as well as shoot beams from various locations.

====Trophy information====
''A Temporal Pokémon. This legendary Pokémon is talked about as a deity in fables passed down through generations in the Sinnoh region. Identifiable by the diamondlike crystal in the center of its chest, Dialga is said to have set time in motion at the moment of its birth. Its fearsome {{m|Roar of Time}} attack is so powerful that it must refrain from attacking on the next turn. It is Diamond's mascot.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Dialga appears as a trophy.

====Trophy information====
''The concept of time has always been one of the world's great mysteries, but Dialga might hold the answer. Legend has it that Dialga's birth caused time to begin moving! It's no surprise that the people of Sinnoh see this Pokémon as a deity. If you're ever running late, maybe you could ask Dialga to do you a favour and turn back the clock.''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness]] [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|& Sky]]: Dialga appears in the main storyline, but mostly as [[Primal Dialga]]. In the future, because of the collapse of the [[Temporal Tower]], Dialga has lost control of itself and has entered a state of self-preservation, keeping time frozen and refusing to let it flow properly. When the player and partner return from the future and arrive at the collapsing Tower, they must beat almost-Primal Dialga in battle and restore the Tower. After putting some sense into it, Dialga is so grateful that it revives the player (who was erased from existence). After going back to Dialga at the top of Temporal Tower, it decides that the player wants a rematch. Once defeated, Dialga joins the player's team. <br> In the Sky-only Special Episode [[In the Future of Darkness]], after the final battle between Primal Dialga and the trio of {{mdc|Grovyle|2}}, {{mdc|Dusknoir|2}} and {{mdc|Celebi|2}}, all of them start to disappear due to the past finally being changed by the player, but are saved by [[Arceus (Pokémon)|an implied higher being than Dialga]], who also restores Dialga to its normal state.
* [[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]]: Dialga appears as a bonus boss during one of the Ranger Net extra missions. Dialga was injured from a battle with Palkia and entered [[Almia Castle]] to recover. It caused a time distortion due to its wounds and sent the main character and {{Ra|Wendy}} back in time to before the events of the game started by using {{m|Roar of Time}}.
* [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]]: Dialga appears in the optional Ranger Net extra mission Pledge to Arceus. It must be captured along with its counterparts Palkia and Giratina in the Sky Fortress to access Arceus.

==Trivia==
* In games prior to [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], Dialga has a catch rate of 30.
* No other Pokémon shares the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Dialga.
* Dialga is tied with Blade Forme {{p|Aegislash}} for the highest {{Stat|Special Attack}} base stat of all {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.
* The spikes on Dialga's back, at a certain point of view, look similar to a [[Time Gears|time gear]]. In the anime, when Dialga uses {{m|Roar of Time}}, the spine extends and the five spikes become thinner and more pronounced.
* Although Dialga is genderless in the main games, it is referred to as a male in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]].
* Dialga is the only Legendary Pokémon to have a role in four different movies.
* According to [[Junichi Masuda]]'s blog, the Spanish translation team suggested changing the name Dialga because of its similarity to the word ''alga'', seaweed.

===Origin===
Dialga, along with {{p|Palkia}}, may be based on the {{wp|Shinto}} legend of {{wp|Izanami}} and {{wp|Izanagi}}, who are said to have created one island with a spear, erected a pillar on it, and from there created the islands of Japan. Appearance-wise, Dialga seems to be based on short-necked sauropod dinosaurs such as ''{{wp|Camarasaurus}}'' or ''{{wp|Brachytrachelopan}}''. Its type is {{t|Steel}} possibly due to the hardness of {{wp|diamonds}}, or the fact that most parts of a clock are made of metal, such as the gears. It may also be because diamonds are compressed carbon, and steel is an alloy from iron and carbon. Its turquoise pattern on its body is vaguely reminiscent to clock hands, where the ends of the "clock hands" are diamond-shaped.

====Name origin====
Dialga is derived from diamond. ''Ga'' may be a corruption of ''gon'' from ''dragon''. It may also involve ''dia'' (Spanish for ''day'', referring to a unit of time) or ''dial'' (as in ''{{wp|sundial}}'', an instrument used to tell time using shadows on a clock face).
