'''Metapod''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''トランセル''' ''Trancell'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Caterpie}} starting at [[level]] 7 and evolves into {{p|Butterfree}} starting at level 10.

==Biology==
Metapod resembles a green {{wp|chrysalis}}. Its body is crescent-shaped with several segments making up the lower point. The front of its shell resembles a face with heavy-lidded eyes and a sharply pointed nose. The back of its shell consists of several geometrically shaped portions and projections. Its soft body is protected by a hard outer shell while it undergoes {{wp|metamorphosis}}. While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its tender body to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, preparing its soft innards for evolution inside its hard shell. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it is unable to do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}.

==In the anime==
===In the [[Pokémon anime|main series]]===

====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Metapod]]=====
{{Ash}} had a Metapod that he caught as a {{p|Caterpie}} and evolved in ''[[EP003|Ash Catches a Pokémon]]''. It eventually evolved into {{p|Butterfree}} in ''[[EP004|Challenge of the Samurai]]''.

=====Other=====
In ''[[EP004|Challenge of the Samurai]]'', [[Samurai]] battled Ash's Metapod with his own Metapod, but because both Metapod only knew {{m|Harden}}, the battle went on for hours until a swarm of {{p|Beedrill}} forced the battle to end.

In ''[[EP144|Gettin' The Bugs Out]]'', [[Bugsy]] used a Metapod against Ash for the Gym Battle. Metapod battled {{AP|Chikorita}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} before being defeated by Pikachu. Unlike most Metapod, this one was actually able to fight back by using {{m|Tackle}}. Multiple other Metapod were also seen in the [[Azalea Gym]] in the same episode.

In ''[[AG142|Caterpie's Big Dilemma]]'', [[Xander]]'s Metapod became [[Giant Pokémon|giant-sized]] after eating some enhanced {{DL|Vitamin|Rare Candy|Rare Candies}}. Xander's Caterpie knocked down part of a radio tower in order to make a place for it to evolve into Metapod. It later evolved again to become a Butterfree.

Multiple Metapod appeared in ''[[BW130|Butterfree and Me!]]'', including one that {{Ash}} worked with to help it eventually evolve into {{p|Butterfree}}.

====Minor appearances====
Multiple Metapod appeared in ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'', where Ash and [[Sam]] witnessed them as they were evolving into Butterfree.

A Metapod appeared in ''[[EP057|The Breeding Center Secret]]''.

A Metapod had a small cameo in ''[[EP097|Tracey Gets Bugged]]'' as one of the Bug Pokémon on [[Murcott Island]].

A Metapod appeared in ''[[EP121|Illusion Confusion!]]'' as an illusion created by {{p|Haunter}} and {{p|Gengar}}.

A Metapod was used by one of the students of the [[Pokémon Trainers' School]] in ''[[AG015|Gonna Rule The School!]]''.

A Metapod appeared in ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]''.

A Metapod appeared in ''[[SM003|Loading the Dex!]]'' as a silhouette that [[Rotom Pokédex]] brought up.

A Metapod appeared in ''[[SM008|Lillie's Egg-xhilarating Challenge!]]'', where it was among the Pokémon playing in {{an|Lillie}}'s garden. It appeared again in ''[[SM030|The Ol' Raise and Switch!]]''.

===In [[Pokémon Origins]]===
[[File:Red Metapod PO.png|thumb|250px|Metapod in [[Pokémon Origins]]]]

==In the manga==
[[File:Ash Metapod EToP.png|thumb|150px|Metapod in [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]]]
===In [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] manga===
{{main|Ash's Metapod}}
{{Ash}}'s Butterfree makes a brief appearance in the manga series [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]. It was first caught in ''[[ET01|Pikachu, I See You!]]'' as a {{p|Caterpie}} and then evolved into Metapod in ''[[ET02|Play Misty For Me]]''. In this appearance it appears to be slightly thinner than other Metapod, as well as having a large spike on its back.

Ash's Metapod evolves into {{p|Butterfree}} in ''Play Misty For Me'' during Ash's Gym battle with {{an|Misty}}. Its last appearance as a Butterfree was in ''[[ET04|Haunting My Dreams]]'', battling a giant {{p|Haunter}}.

===In the [[How I Became a Pokémon Card]] manga===
{{HIBAPC|Midori}} was shown to have a Metapod.

===In the [[Magical Pokémon Journey]] manga===
A Metapod fell down from a tree in [[PPP02|Clefairy Comes Through]]. [[Hazel]] put it back where it was. Then it fell back again.

[[File:Kitty Metapod.png|thumb|right|200px|Metapod in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga===
{{main|Kitty}}
Metapod's first appearance is a cameo in ''[[PS002|Bulbasaur, Come Home!]]'' as one of the Pokémon that gets out of his [[Poké ball]] in [[Professor Oak's Laboratory]]. 

In ''[[PS089|The Might of... Metapod?]]'', {{adv|Yellow}}'s {{p|Caterpie}}, which was called "Kitty", briefly evolved into Metapod before evolving again into [[Kitty|Butterfree]] during Yellow's showdown with [[Lance]].

[[Bugsy]] also uses two Metapod on his team, one the first appeared in ''[[PS100|Into the Unown]]''. It again appeared in ''[[PS102|Ursaring Major]]'' where it, a Kakuna and Bugsy visited the [[Azalea Town]]'s well where Team Rocket had been.

According to the Pokédex at the end of [[Pokémon Adventures volume 1|Volume 1]], Red appears to have captured a Caterpie which evolved into a Metapod and then a Butterfree.

===In the [[Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys]] manga===
Bugsy's Butterfree was first seen as a Metapod in ''[[GB04|Let's Aim For The Goal!]]''. It evolved prior to ''[[GB11|Gold And Black VS. Team Rocket]]''.

==Trivia==
* Metapod shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Kakuna}}, {{p|Silcoon}}, and {{p|Cascoon}}. They are all known as the Cocoon Pokémon.
** They also share the same base stat total, learnset, Ability, and EV yield.
*** This ties them as the evolved Pokémon with the lowest base stat total.
* Metapod is the first Pokémon to evolve in [[M04|a movie]], and part of the first evolution cycle in [[EP003|an episode]].
* Until the release of {{game|Platinum}}, when its pre-evolution became able to learn {{m|Bug Bite}}, Metapod was unable to damage {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon except by using {{m|Struggle}}. It shared this trait with {{p|Caterpie}}.
** Due to this, it was impossible to complete a [[Generation I]] game using only Caterpie or Metapod since Struggle could not hit Ghost types at the time.
* Metapod is usually depicted with white sclerae, such as in the games, trading cards, and promotional illustrations, but it has yellow sclerae in the anime.
* In the anime episode ''[[EP004|Challenge of the Samurai]]'', the process of Metapod's evolution was similar to a real life butterfly emerging from its cocoon. In [[AG142|later]] [[BW130|episodes]], however, Metapod is shown to evolve like any other Pokémon.
* {{wp|Ume Aoki}}, a Japanese cartoonist famous for her work on the manga ''Hidamari Sketch'', utilizes a likeness of herself cosplaying as a Metapod to represent herself in her works.
* In the Space World '97 [[Super Game Boy]] demo version of Pokémon Gold, Metapod has a unique orange sprite that is exclusive to the demo.

===Origin===
It to be based upon an amalgamation of butterfly chrysalises, resembling the general shape of a {{wp|Black Swallowtail}} chrysalis (or possibly a {{wp|Large White}}) with a large nose-like protrusion and side portrusions resembling a {{wp|Polydamas Swallowtail}} or {{wp|Pipevine Swallowtail}} chrysalis.

====Name origin====
Metapod is a combination of ''{{wp|metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis}}'' and ''pod'' (referring to its {{wp|Pupa|chrysalis}} state).

Trancell appears to be a combination of ''transform'' and ''{{wp|cell}}'' or ''shell''.
