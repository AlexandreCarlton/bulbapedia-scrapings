'''Blastoise''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カメックス''' ''Kamex'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Wartortle}} starting at [[level]] 36. It is the final form of {{p|Squirtle}}. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Blastoise''' using the [[Blastoisinite]].

Blastoise is the [[game mascot]] of the [[Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese)|Japanese]] and international versions of [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Blue]], appearing on the boxart of both.

==Biology==
Blastoise is a large, bipedal turtle-like Pokémon. Its body is blue and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a pale yellow underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons reside in the top sides of its shell. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn and can be used to assist in high-speed charges. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick and striated with three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. It has a stubby tail.

As Mega Blastoise, it develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with their own water cannon. The two cannons on its back are replaced by a single, central water cannon of greater size. This cannon extends forward over Mega Blastoise's head and is said to have a blast range of over 6 miles (10&nbsp;km).<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Blastoise</ref> Small ridges develop over its, now red, eyes and extend to its ears. The ears angle slightly backward and there is a small point on its chin.

The powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back are capable of producing water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete. Blastoise deliberately makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts, and it will crush its opponents with its bulk. It has two former [[signature move]]s, {{m|Skull Bash}} and {{m|Hydro Cannon}}. [[EP060|The anime has shown]] that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of {{p|Squirtle}} and {{p|Wartortle}}. Its preferred habitat seems to be {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's Edge Pokémon|freshwater ponds and lakes}}.

====Trophy information====
''"Blastoise is the next evolutionary step after Wartortle. The thick jets of water they shoot from the cannons on their backs are strong enough to cut through steel plating. When in danger, they hide inside their armored shells. Blastoise is so popular among Trainers that it's considered the definitive {{type|Water}}."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Blastoise appears in the background of the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Flood Chamber}} in the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}}, along with {{p|Wailord}}, {{p|Piplup}}, and {{p|Clawitzer}}. A trophy of Mega Blastoise also exists in both versions.
====Trophy information====
=====Blastoise=====
'''NA:''' ''On a hot summer day, it's great to cool off by playing in a sprinkler. Don't look to Blastoise as a replacement, though&mdash;those water jets on its back are extremely powerful and would send you flying. In fact, Blastoise itself is so huge so it doesn't get blown away when it fires. Speaking of fires, Blastoise is better than a fire truck at putting them out!''

'''PAL:''' ''Tempted to have a Blastoise hose the mud off your bike? Well, don't. The water jets from its rocket cannons might look perfect for that, but they'd just blast your bike into oblivion. In fact, the reason Blastoise grow so big and heavy is so they don't get blown away themselves. If your house is on fire, though, feel free to get a Blastoise to help!''
=====Mega Blastoise=====
'''NA''': ''Some species of Pokémon living in [[Kalos]] have the ability to Mega Evolve, and here's one! Mega Blastoise is a bit bigger than Blastoise, and instead of two cannons on its shell, it has one huge cannon. This may seem like a downgrade, but wait–there are two on its arms! This math is easy: three is better than two.''

'''PAL''': ''Some species of Pokémon living in Kalos have the ability to Mega Evolve, and here's one! Mega Blastoise is a bit bigger than Blastoise, and instead of two cannons on its shell, it has one huge cannon. This may seem like a downgrade, but wait - there are two on its arms, too! Basic arithmetic: three is better than two.''

==Trivia==
* Blastoise shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Kabuto}} and {{p|Kabutops}}. They are all known as the Shellfish Pokémon.

===Origin===
Its design appears to be a {{wp|turtle}} mixed with aspects of a {{wp|tank}}. Blastoise's cannons may have been derived from the functioning tubes found in {{wp|mussel}}s and some other shellfish, thus its {{pkmn|category}}.

====Name origin====
Blastoise's name is a combination of ''blast'' (referring to its cannons) and ''{{wp|tortoise}}''.

Kamex comes from the Japanese word 亀 ''kame'' (tortoise/turtle) and possibly マックス ''max'' (maximum).

==In other languages==
