'''Magnemite''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コイル''' ''Coil'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation II]], it was a pure {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Magneton}} starting at [[level]] 30, which evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]].

==Biology==
Magnemite is a seemingly robotic life form that has a gray, spherical metal body with horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three {{wp|Phillips head}} screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body, and the other on top of its head and looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, [[EP101|the anime has shown]] that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. [[EP195|It has even exhibited]] the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|power plants or caves}} with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, [[Media:Neo Premium File 2.jpg|Magnemite has been depicted in carvings]] discovered at the [[Ruins of Alph]], and has been present in [[AZ]]'s retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.

The magnetic units on Magnemite's body create electromagnetic waves that allow it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive, but may approach Trainers with little notice. It can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a [[Pokétch]]. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately spit out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. [[EP030|It has even been shown]] to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, [[EP195|it has been demonstrated that]] it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. If a wild Magnemite is approached, [[Escape#Wild Pokémon|it may simply flee]] on rare occasions, as Magnemite do not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will start retaliation with non-damaging moves.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===
[[File:Clemont Magnemite.png|thumb|250px|Magnemite in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====
Magnemite debuted in ''[[EP030|Sparks Fly for Magnemite]]''. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} were in [[Gringey City]] while the power went out. When they were looking around for the cause of the power outage, a lone Magnemite showed up and was attracted to [[Ash's Pikachu]], who had a cold. When a group of {{p|Grimer}} and its {{AP|Muk}} leader were chasing Ash and his friends, a group of Magnemite and {{p|Magneton}} helped to fight them off.

In ''[[EP101|Get Along, Little Pokémon]]'', Ash, {{an|Misty}}, and {{Tracey}} met a man named {{OBP|Ethan|EP101}} who used Magnemite to harness electrical energy from bolts of lightning during thunderstorms, with this energy being given to towns without power. Magnemite #6 evolved into a Magneton to save Ash and Pikachu from {{TRT}}.

A Magnemite belonging to the [[Olivine City]] Gym Leader, [[Jasmine]], debuted in ''[[EP208|Fight for the Light!]]'', where it was riding on Jasmine's shoulder through the whole episode. It was later used in her Gym battle with Ash in ''[[EP224|Nerves of Steelix!]]'', in which she sent it out against {{AP|Pikachu}}. Pikachu was able to defeat Magnemite with {{m|Quick Attack}}.

A Magnemite appeared in ''[[AG040|Watt's with Wattson?]]'', under the ownership of [[Wattson]]. Much like Jasmine's Magnemite, this Magnemite battled Pikachu during Ash's Gym battle against Wattson. It was defeated when Pikachu became overpowered. Multiple wild Magnemite also appeared later on in the episode.

A Magnemite appeared in [[PK13]], in which it attacked Meowth and Wobbuffet with {{m|Thunder Wave}}, but it was quickly defeated by Wobbuffet's {{m|Counter}}.

An army of Magnemite and {{p|Magneton}}, led by a {{p|Magnezone}}, appeared in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]'', under the ownership of the main antagonist [[Zero]]. They were mainly used by Zero as a swarm to trap or capture targets. They were also able to contain people and Pokémon by linking together around them, preventing them from moving.

{{an|Brock}} temporarily trained a Magnemite belonging to the [[Pokémon Summer Academy]] in ''[[DP088|Camping It Up!]]''. Unlike the rest of the group, Brock had no problems bonding with and educating his Pokémon.

A wild Magnemite appeared in ''[[BW087|Expedition to Onix Island!]]'', when it attacked {{an|Iris}} and {{TP|Iris|Axew}} with an Electric attack.

{{an|Clemont}} owns a Magnemite that appeared in ''[[XY009|Clemont's Got a Secret!]]''. It stays at the Lumiose City Gym. Clemont's Magnemite was later used in a Gym Battle against [[Alvin]] who defeated Magnemite with his {{p|Vivillon}}.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Magnemite was originally known as "Coil", from its Japanese name.
* Magnemite, along with its evolution {{p|Magneton}}, were pure Electric-type Pokémon in Generation I, but became dual-type {{2t|Electric|Steel}} in Generation II. This makes them the first Pokémon to ever change typing.
* Magnemite is the first Steel-type Pokémon in [[National Pokédex]] order.
* Despite most of Magnemite's Pokédex entries saying they are able to float through the air by employing powerful electromagnetic waves or even anti-gravity, Magnemite does not have the Ability {{a|Levitate}}, so it is still affected by {{type|Ground}} moves. However, starting in [[Generation IV]], Magnemite can learn {{m|Magnet Rise}}, which simulates Levitate for five turns.
* Magnemite, along with {{p|Magneton}}, has [[List of Pokémon that appear in every regional Pokédex|appeared in every regional Pokédex]]. This is due to the Sinnoh Pokédex's expansion in Platinum and the Unova Pokédex's expansion in Black 2 and White 2.
* Magnemite and its evolution Magneton are two of the few Pokémon that had their [[cry]] changed slightly in [[Generation III]]. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and [[Game Boy Advance|newer game system]].
* {{g|Snap}} is the only form of a Pokémon canon that shows two Magnemite bonding, similar to a Magneton. However, when a picture is taken, they are still called Magnemite.
** {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}} also showed this, but it was stated to be a failed evolution, due to the lack of a third Magnemite.
* In [[Generation V]], Magnemite was the most traded Pokémon on the [[GTS]]. This is probably due to what is known as the Magnemite chain/coil: a scheme by which players could increase the number of visitors to their [[Join Avenue]] in {{2v2|Black|White|2}} by trading Magnemite on the GTS. The scheme originated with Japanese players and became popular worldwide.
* On May 31, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] posted a Magnemite-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled [[Where is Coil? Here is Coil!]].

===Origin===
Magnemite seems to be based on a {{wp|magnet}}. It may also be based on the objectification of {{wp|electromagnetism}}, one of the four {{wp|fundamental interactions}} of nature.

====Name origin====
Magnemite may be a play on ''{{wp|magnetite}}''. It may also be a combination of ''magnet'' or ''magnetite'' and ''mite'', referring to its small size.

Coil is literally ''coil'', perhaps referring to the fact that a coil with electric current generates a magnetic field.
