'''Manaphy''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マナフィ''' ''Manaphy'') is a {{type|Water}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon. Manaphy has the unusual ability to breed, despite being a Mythical Pokémon. It is also unusual in that its offspring are {{p|Phione}}, which do not evolve into Manaphy, and that Manaphy Eggs have a different appearance from other Pokémon Eggs.

It is a member of the [[sea guardians]] with Phione.

Manaphy was the last Pokémon in the [[List of Pokémon by Sinnoh Pokédex number|Sinnoh Pokédex]] before the {{v2|Platinum}} expansion.

==Biology==
Manaphy is a small, blue, aquatic Pokémon with stubby feet and club-like arms that are longer than its body. It has a red gem on its chest and a yellow dot below the gem. Its onion-shaped head has a pair of long blue antennae, which have small spheres on the ends. Its irises are dark blue with yellow sclera, and there are two yellow dots of “eyelash” markings extending from the eyes.

Eighty percent of Manaphy's body is made of water. It is highly susceptible to its environment, and swims long distances to return to its birthplace. It is born with a special power that allows it to bond with any Pokémon. Manaphy can switch the perspective of people, and Pokémon, with each other using its former [[signature move]], {{m|Heart Swap}}.

It was later mentioned in ''[[DP089|Up Close and Personable!]]''.

[[File:Manaphy Egg PR.png|thumb|left|200px|A Manaphy {{pkmn|Egg}} in [[W Mission Story: Pokémon Ranger - the Comic]]]]
===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Manaphy (M09)}}
Manaphy is a main character in the ninth [[Pokémon movie]], ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]''. Likewise, it appears in the {{ma|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea|manga adaptation}} of the film by [[Makoto Mizobuchi]].

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
Manaphy appears as a silhouette in the {{chap|Emerald}} of the [[Pokémon Adventures]] {{pkmn|manga}}. [[Guile Hideout]] questions going after it should he succeed in his plans. It later appeared in a silhouette in ''[[PS430|Unplugging Rotom (Heat, Wash, Mow, Fan, Frost)]]''.

In ''[[PS441|The Final Dimensional Duel XI]]'', Manaphy's Egg was sent from Fiore to {{adv|Diamond}} and {{adv|Pearl}}, who hatched it. Later, a Phione Egg appeared by Manaphy at the Pokémon Day Care in Solaceon. It was walking with the [[Day-Care Couple]], where it meets its offspring through the fence.

===In the Pocket Monsters DP manga===
Manaphy first appears as an {{pkmn|Egg}} in ''[[PMDP11|I Want to See a Pro Game!!]]'' which {{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} and his Pokémon find on sea. {{OBP|Professor Oak|Pocket Monsters}} investigates it and tells the group about the Egg hatching into a Legendary Pokémon. It later hatches into Manaphy but becomes lazy due to {{TP|Red|Clefairy}}'s parenting skills.

===In the W Mission Story: Pokémon Ranger - the Comic manga===
In the manga [[W Mission Story: Pokémon Ranger - the Comic]], {{ra|Cameron}} from [[Summerland]] found Manaphy's Egg on Fiore's Sea. Then, it was stolen by the [[Go-Rock Squad]], who wanted to use its enormous powers for bad purposes when it hatched. This plan failed when [[Solana]] and [[Lunick]] saved the Egg and it was given to a {{adv|Diamond|Trainer}} who lives in [[Sinnoh]].

==In the TCG==

==Other appearances==
[[File:Manaphy SSBB.png|thumb|220px|Manaphy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Manaphy uses {{m|Heart Swap}}, which temporarily switches the body of the user with another player. KO's count for the player in control, not the character's normal player, preventing easy KOs via suicide.

====Trophy information====
''"A Seafaring Pokémon. Eighty percent of its body is made of water. It has the ability Hydration, which allows it to restore status effects at the end of the turn if it's [[rain]]ing. It is the only Pokémon who can use the stat-effect-swapping move called {{m|Heart Swap}}. Place a Manaphy and a {{p|Ditto}} in the Pokémon Day Care, and they will produce a Phione egg."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Manaphy appears as an occasional stage hazard in the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Flood Chamber}} of the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. Appearing rarely, it will use {{m|Whirlpool}} to create a maelstrom on the floor of the stage, sucking in any fighters standing in the water in an attempt to KO them.

====Trophy information====
''This Water-type Pokémon is said to have the mysterious ability to bond with any other Pokémon. It's also said to appear occasionally in the Water-type Elite Four Trainer's room in the Kalos Pokémon League stage. When it appears on the stage, it'll use its Whirlpool move to drag fighters into the middle of the swirling waters.''

[[Chatot (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)|Chatot ]] arranges for Manaphy to live with a {{p|Walrein}} but returns soon after the defeat of {{mdc|Darkrai|2}} to officially join the team now that he has grown up.

==Trivia==
* Manaphy's English name was uncovered, alongside the English name of [[Sinnoh]], within the internal data of {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}} on November 2, 2006.
* Manaphy and {{p|Ditto}} are the only Pokémon that are both able to breed and are unobtainable through breeding.
* Manaphy and {{p|Phione}} (if Phione is Mythical) are the only Mythical Pokémon capable of producing Eggs in a {{pkmn|Day Care}} legitimately.
* Although normally genderless, in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]], Manaphy is constantly referred to as a male.
** It is also known as the "Prince of the Sea".
* In the games, Manaphy is the only Pokémon whose Egg sprite is different than the standard sprite.
** Despite the fact that Eggs cannot be transferred via [[Poké Transfer]], Manaphy's Egg is found in {{Gdis|List of Pokémon by index number|V|the coding of}} the [[Generation V]] games. {{gdis|List of locations by index number|V|Location data}} for Pokémon Ranger also exists in those games.
* Like the majority of [[Event Pokémon]] obtained through [[Mystery Gift]], it was intended to be impossible to obtain a {{Shiny}} Manaphy. However, an oversight allows a Manaphy Egg to have a chance to hatch Shiny, but only if it was traded before hatching. This is because Shininess is dependent on the [[Trainer ID number]] and Secret ID number, and the game mistakenly attempts to prevent Shininess using the original game's ID numbers instead of the ID numbers of the game that it was traded to. Furthermore, any Shiny Manaphy that was hatched from a traded egg can be able to pass Poké Transporter's legality check.

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Manaphy and Phione}}
Manaphy may be based on {{wp|sea angel}}s, tiny transparent ocean mollusks. The Manaphy Egg's design is similar to ''{{wp|Turritopsis dohrnii}}''.

====Name origin====
Manaphy may be a combination of ''{{wp|mana}}'' and a shortening of ''fairy''. It may also come from the manatee, or sea cow.
