'''Rayquaza''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レックウザ''' ''Rayquaza'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Rayquaza''', but only if it knows the move {{m|Dragon Ascent}} and is not holding a [[Z-Crystal]]. In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the Rayquaza featured in the [[Delta Episode]] must be {{pkmn2|caught}} (which requires it to eat the [[Meteorite]]) before the player can Mega Evolve any Rayquaza.

Rayquaza is the game mascot of {{game|Emerald}}, appearing on the boxart of the game. It serves to end the conflict between {{p|Kyogre}} and {{p|Groudon}} when [[Team Magma]]'s leader [[Maxie]] and [[Team Aqua]]'s leader [[Archie]] awakened them.

Along with Kyogre and Groudon, Rayquaza is a part of the [[weather trio]], serving as its [[trio master]]. In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, it plays an important role during the Delta Episode and is required to be [[Caught Pokémon|caught]] there.

==Biology==
Rayquaza is a large, green, serpentine creature. It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.

As Mega Rayquaza, its body becomes longer and gains more features. Its head becomes longer with the {{tt|Δ|Delta}} symbol appearing on its forehead. Its eyes now contain yellow pupils and red irises, and black, tree-like markings trail behind its eyes. Its red lips and teeth become gold, and the gold lines connect to those on its lower horns, which take on a broad, triangular shape. At the outer edges of its lower horns are long, golden, glowing tendrils that each extend to a green, fin-like structure; these tendrils have ring patterns that strongly resemble the yellow markings running along the length of Rayquaza's normal form. Its two upper horns become longer with a gold line running over them in a V shape, and each upper horn has another glowing tendril that ends in a circular shape with a spike. Along the length of its body are golden, glowing orbs placed where its ring patterns used to be. The chin, part of the neck, and parts of its serpentine body are changed to the color black. The fins running along its body are now marked with gold lines; the fins on its tail become entirely yellow and substantially longer. Particles stream from the long tendrils that extend from its jutting jaw; these particles can control the density and humidity of the air, allowing Mega Rayquaza to manipulate the weather. Its green hide sparkles with an emerald-like quality.<ref name="Mega">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/mega-rayquaza</ref>

Inside Rayquaza's body lies an organ that contains the same power as a [[Mega Stone]]. A [[Devon Corporation]] scientist named this organ the mikado organ (Japanese: '''ミカド{{tt|器官|きかん}}'''). By consuming meteoroids as it flies through the stratosphere, the mikado organ will be filled with enough energy to enable Rayquaza's Mega Evolution.

It is able to soothe the other members of the weather trio, even in their [[Primal Reversion|Primal Forms]]. Rayquaza can live for hundreds of millions of years in the {{wp|ozone layer}}, where it feeds on water and other particles. Rayquaza is {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rarely}} seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. Rayquaza is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Dragon Ascent}}.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Rayquaza (M07)]]=====
{{OBP|Rayquaza|M07}} debuted in ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''. It fights against {{OBP|Deoxys|M07}}, believing it to be invading the Sky High Pokémon's territory when Deoxys was in fact looking for its friend, another Deoxys.

=====[[Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime#Rayquaza|Rayquaza (anime)]]=====
A Rayquaza appeared in ''[[SS031|Mega Evolution Special II]]'', where it [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]]. [[Alain]] and {{Steven}} tried to battle it, but were quickly defeated by the Sky High Pokémon. It reappeared in ''[[SS032|Mega Evolution Special III]]''.

=====Other=====
In ''[[DP043|Malice In Wonderland!]]'', a Rayquaza appeared under ownership of [[Cynthia]], but as an illusion created by {{p|Mismagius}}. When Mismagius fuses with Rayquaza, it becomes the same color as the Mismagius, making it look like a Shiny Rayquaza.

Rayquaza made its main series debut in outer space in ''[[DP142|Where No Togepi Has Gone Before!]]''. In the episode, it used {{m|Hyper Beam}} on the rocket ship {{Ash}}, {{ashfr}}, and {{TRT}} were on, presumably in order to protect its territory from them.

A Rayquaza appeared in [[SS028]], where it was seen by {{an|Iris}}.

A {{Shiny}} Rayquaza capable of Mega Evolving appeared in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', summoned alongside {{p|Latios}} and {{p|Latias}} by {{an|Hoopa}} to protect it from the shadow [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound]]. The trio protected Hoopa from the shadow Hoopa and its reinforcements, [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Groudon}}, Primal {{p|Kyogre}}, {{p|Dialga}}, {{p|Palkia}}, {{p|Giratina}}, and {{p|Kyurem}}, in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, the battle ended after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], and Rayquaza departed for its home.

====Minor appearances====
A Rayquaza made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'', where it was captured by Team Rocket operatives.

A Rayquaza made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)#Rayquaza|Rayquaza (Adventures)}}
To stop the battle between Kyogre and Groudon, {{adv|Wally}} and [[Norman]] trained at the [[Sky Pillar]] and woke up Rayquaza. Five years earlier, {{adv|Ruby}}'s victory over a {{p|Salamence}} was the reason Norman was banned from the Gym Leader test as the wounded Salamence rampaged in a lab, accidentally letting Rayquaza, who was in captivity at that time, free. Having been ordered to recapture Rayquaza in the five years he was prohibited from attaining a Gym Leader position, Norman attended the [[Mossdeep Space Center]] and scrutinized its tracks, finally discovering that it slumbered atop the [[Sky Pillar]] when it wasn't scouring beyond Earth's atmosphere. With Wally's help, he was able to awaken and take command of Rayquaza, using it to calm {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}} in conjunction with Ruby's [[Red Orb|Red]] and [[Blue Orb]]s. When Norman fell under the strain of controlling Rayquaza without a proper medium, it escaped once again. It first appeared in ''[[PS258|Rayquaza Redemption I]]''.

===In the Pokémon Ruby-Sapphire manga===

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:Rayquaza Brawl.png|thumb|left|200px|Rayquaza in Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]
Rayquaza appears in [[The Subspace Emissary]] mode as a boss. After {{smw|Diddy Kong}} lands in {{sbw|The Lake}}, Rayquaza lunges out of the water and grabs him, angry at being disrupted. Before it can further attack, {{smw|Fox McCloud|Fox}} ejects out of his ship, which had crashed and been destroyed by Rayquaza earlier, and rescues Diddy Kong. Enraged, Rayquaza attacks Fox with {{m|Dragon Pulse}}, but Fox {{sbw|Reflector|reflects}} its attack back at it, sending it reeling back into the water. Rayquaza soon launches back out and engages in battle against Fox and Diddy Kong.

Like all other Subspace Emissary bosses, Rayquaza is later battled again in {{sbw|The Great Maze}}, and can be fought in the {{sbw|Boss Battles}} mode after the latter is unlocked. Its attacks in battle include {{m|ExtremeSpeed}}, {{m|Thunder}}, {{m|Dig}}, {{m|Iron Tail}}, and {{m|Fly}}.

====Trophy information====
''A Sky High Pokémon. It normally resides high up in the ozone layer where it flies endlessly, so it is rarely seen. However, when {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}} began to fight, it appeared to calm them down. It has the ability {{a|Air Lock}}, which blocks all weather-condition effects. It has exceedingly strong abilities, and its attack power is especially remarkable.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
[[File:Kalos Pokémon League Dragonmark Chamber SSB4WU.png|thumb|250px|Rayquaza in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]
Rayquaza appears as an occasional stage hazard in the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Dragonmark Chamber}} of the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. Appearing rarely, it flies across the stage at various angles, dealing damage to fighters. Its path is shown briefly by lightning before it appears, giving players time to avoid it.

====Trophy information====
''This Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon usually dwells high in the ozone layer, so it can't be seen from the ground. In the Kalos Pokemon League stage, it occasionally flies at great speed through the Elite Four's Dragon-type chamber, where any fighters in its path will be damaged and launched with great force.''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire}}: Rayquaza is the focus of the third and final Bonus Field. It can only be challenged after capturing {{p|Groudon}} or {{p|Kyogre}} and will then join the circuit of bonus fields. Rayquaza will bounce along from left to right, allowing the ball to roll under it if it is up. It will sometimes use {{m|Thunder}} to paralyze the ball if it is not moving fast enough, though it does stay still while it is unleashing the attack. Rayquaza will also sometimes use {{m|ExtremeSpeed}} to create two tornadoes that cause the ball to fly up into the air for several seconds if contact is made. Rayquaza must be hit 15 times in three minutes to win. After beating the round twice, Rayquaza will be captured.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]: Rayquaza acts as the final boss, living on the [[Sky Tower]]. After it is defeated, Rayquaza helps save the {{pkmn|world (Mystery Dungeon)|world}} from a meteor. After the credits roll, the player can re-battle Rayquaza to recruit it.
* {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}}: Rayquaza can be captured in a bonus mission after the credits.
* {{ga|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Darkness}}: Rayquaza is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Sky Melodica]].

==Trivia==
* Rayquaza has many differences from the other members of [[weather trio|its trio]]:
** It is the only member without a [[Primal Reversion|Primal form]], instead having the ability to [[Mega Evolve]].
** It is the only member not to be directly sought after by a specific crime syndicate.
** It is the only member that cannot learn an [[One-hit knockout move|OHKO]] move.
** It is the only member that cannot learn its [[signature move]] by level-up, as it must learn it by move tutor.
** It is the only member that didn't appear in the episodes ''[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]'' and ''[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]''.
* Mega Rayquaza has the highest {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Attack}} stats and the highest base stat total of all {{type|Dragon}} and {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* Mega Rayquaza is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Flying}} Pokémon, the tallest Mega Evolved Pokémon and the tallest [[Legendary Pokémon]].
* Rayquaza's catch rate was raised from its original value of 3 to 45 in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.
* Rayquaza is the only Legendary Pokémon that can be caught at a higher level than the [[Elite Four]]'s Pokémon before defeating the {{Ho|Elite Four}}. However, this is only possible in {{g|Emerald}}.
* Rayquaza was the most voted Pokémon of all pre-[[Generation V]] Pokémon in the {{pmin|South Korea|Korean}} [[Pokémon Global Link]] [[List of Pokémon Global Link promotions/Pokémon#Rayquaza|promotion]] poll.
** Rayquaza was also the most voted on the {{DL|List of local Japanese event Pokémon distributions in Generation V|15th Anniversary Rayquaza|15th anniversary poll}}, which was for the [[game mascot]]s of the [[core series]] Pokémon games, making it Japan's favorite game mascot.
* Rayquaza is misspelled as "Rayquayza" in {{g|Team Turbo}} in every instance.
* Rayquaza is the only Pokémon capable of Mega Evolving that does not require a [[Mega Stone]] to do so in the games.
** It is therefore the only Pokémon that can have a different held item while Mega Evolved, since Mega Stones cannot be taken off their proper holder during battle.
* Mega Rayquaza is tied with {{p|Mewtwo}}'s Mega Evolutions for the highest base stat total of all Pokémon, with 780.
** This makes it the only Pokémon with a base stat total above 720 that doesn't require a specific held item.
* When Mega Evolving Rayquaza, the game will state, "<player>'s fervent wish has reached Rayquaza", instead of the normal message.

===Origin===
Rayquaza may be based on the Hebrew legends of {{wp|Ziz}}, the unconquerable primal master of the sky. Its counterparts were {{wp|Behemoth}} and {{wp|Leviathan}}. Rayquaza's appearance also draws inspiration from other creatures of myth such as the {{wp|Asian dragon}} and ''{{wp|lindworm}}''. Alternatively, Rayquaza matches the description of the Aztec god {{wp|Quetzalcoatl}}, who was depicted as a flying serpent, and created the boundary between the earth (including the oceans) and the sky. Its trait of being capable of inhabiting the skies, and living there while subsisting on nothing but dew and particles for centuries, also bears aspects of the legendary Chinese xian hermit sages and East Asian dragons.

====Name origin====
Rayquaza most likely refers to ''{{wp|Raqiya}}'', the Hebrew word for "firmament". It also may be a combination of ''{{wp|ray (geometry)|ray}}'' and ''{{wp|quasar}}''. Alternatively, it may be a combination of 烈 ''retsu'' (violent or furious), 空 ''kū'' (sky), and 座 ''za'' (seat or location), which can be taken to mean "one that sits in the ferocious heavens".

Rayquaza's mikado organ refers to 帝 ''mikado'' (emperor), another name for the {{wp|Emperor of Japan}} or 天皇 ''tennō'' in Japanese, which can be translated as either "heavenly sovereign" or "king of the heaven/sky".
