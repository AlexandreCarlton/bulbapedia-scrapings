'''Electabuzz''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''エレブー''' ''Eleboo'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Elekid}} starting at [[level]] 30 and evolves into {{p|Electivire}} when [[trade]]d holding an [[Electirizer]].

==Biology==
Electabuzz is a slightly humanoid creature with a few feline traits. It is covered in yellow fur with black stripes; a large stripe on its chest is shaped like a lightning bolt. It has a long tail. There are three, clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, while it has five fingers on each hand. Electabuzz has two sharp fangs and a pair of antennae with bulbous ends. In the dark, Electabuzz will glow a light blue with the electrical charge stored inside of it.

Electabuzz is capable of storing huge amounts of electrical energy inside of its body over long periods. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to determine which is capable of attaining the highest ground, so as to be most likely struck by a bolt of lightning. If struck, Electabuzz will absorb the electricity and will not be harmed. It is in this same manner that captured Electabuzz are sometimes used in small towns as an alternative to lightning rods.

As demonstrated in [[EP042|the anime]], Electabuzz is enraged by the color red. If this Pokémon sees the color red, it will become violent and raze the area around it. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as its opponent has been known to escape in the meantime. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when in close proximity to another of its species. Electabuzz typically resides in or around power plants, and can also be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}. It has been known to wander into cities and cause blackouts.

==Trivia==
[[File:Stadium125.png|thumb|right|150px|Note its fingers]]
* Electabuzz and its {{p|Elekid|pre-evolution}} share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Zapdos}}. They are all known as the Electric Pokémon.
* {{p|Magmar}} and Electabuzz seem to be counterparts; both evolve in a very similar way (first at level 30, then after being traded holding an item which has a name that ends with the suffix "-izer"), and both are typically exclusive to one version of a pair of games. They both have similar status-inducing Abilities in Flame Body and Static, as well as the same Hidden Ability, Vital Spirit. Since Generation V, they also often learn similar moves at the same level. They even have the same special moves when purified in Pokémon XD: {{m|Follow Me}} and {{m|Cross Chop}}. Their pre-evolutions and evolutions were released in the same generation (Generation II and IV).
* Electabuzz is the only member of its family not to have some physical relation to an {{wp|AC power plugs and sockets|AC power unit}}. Elekid's head is shaped like a power plug while Electivire's back pattern looks like a power socket.
* Electabuzz is depicted with six fingers (five fingers and one thumb) on both of its hands in [[Pokémon Stadium]].

===Origin===
Electabuzz is likely based on the Japanese {{wp|oni (Japanese folklore)|oni}} that was a horned ogre that wore tiger skin and was sometimes depicted as a god of lightning and thunder. Its tail looks like that of a {{wp|tiger}}.
====Name origin====
Electabuzz is a combination of ''electric'' and ''buzz'' (possibly referring to the humming sound of electricity).

Eleboo may be a combination of ''electric'' and ブンブン ''bunbun'' (buzz).
