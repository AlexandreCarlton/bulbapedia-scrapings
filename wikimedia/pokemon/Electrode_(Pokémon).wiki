'''Electrode''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マルマイン''' ''Marumine'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Voltorb}} starting at [[level]] 30.

==Biology==
Electrode is a round Pokémon resembling a reverse-colored [[Poké Ball]] with a mouth and eyes. Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. For this reason, many Trainers try to pick it up, mistaking it for an item. The [[Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards]] depict Electrode as hollow. Many know it by the nickname "Bomb Ball."

Electrode tends to live in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|power plants}} where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===

==In the manga==
[[File:Eusine Electrode Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Electrode in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
Electrode makes a cameo aboard the [[S.S. Anne]] in ''[[PS010|Danger: High Voltorb]]'' as one of [[Lt. Surge]]'s Pokémon ready to attack {{adv|Red}}. Lt. Surge also possesses a cannon capable of firing Electrode at high speeds to attack, supplied by Team Rocket technology in ''[[PS029|Go for the Golbat]]''. Since the disbandment of [[Team Rocket]] in ''[[PS090|The Legend]]'', Lt. Surge is technically no longer a member, and it is unconfirmed if he still possesses the weaponry.

Ken of the Team Rocket Elite Trio used an Electrode along with its devolved form, Voltorb, to attack {{adv|Yellow}} in ''[[PS056|The Coming of Slowpoke (Eventually)]]''.

A Team Rocket Grunt in Johto owns an Electrode in ''[[PS093|Sneasel Sneak Attack]]''.

A drawing of an Electrode appeared on a store in Violet City's Famous Rice-Cake store in ''[[PS096|Number One Donphan]]''.

[[Eusine]], as seen in ''[[PS126|Jumping Jumpluff]]'', possesses an Electrode as well, allowing him to travel over large distances by riding it. Eusine's Electrode apparently uses electric charges to suspend itself in mid-air. It was temporarily given to {{adv|Crystal}} to follow Suicune in ''[[PS128|Indubitably Ditto]]'' to ''[[PS129|Great Girafarig]]'' where they reached the [[Bell Tower|Tin Tower]]. It had helped Crystal float during the battle against Suicune in ''[[PS130|SUddenly Suicune I]]'' to ''[[PS132|Suddenly Suiunce III]]'', in the latter it was seen over the debris near the Tin Tower, and was later retrieved back by its owner.

In ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' an Electrode was one of the Pokémon sent to help the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

The author, [[Hidenori Kusaka]], used an Electrode in {{PAV|4}} (JP version) as self-portrait, continuing to do so ever since. Before that, he always depicted himself as a regular man.

[[Wattson]]'s Electrode was only seen in ''[[PS204|Plugging Past Electrike I]]'', inside the Power Plant located in [[New Mauville]].

Electrode was selected as an enemy Pokémon for the [[Frontier Brain]]s' demonstration battle in ''[[PS304|Swanky Showdown with Swalot]]'', alongside {{p|Swalot}}, which represents illustrator [[Satoshi Yamamoto]].

The Battle Factory rented an Electrode which was stolen by [[Guile Hideout]] in ''[[PS334|The Final Battle VII]]''.

In a flashback an Electrode appeared as a Pokémon trained by the [[International Police]] in ''[[PS528|Innocent Scientist]]'', also alongside Swalot.

===In the Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga===
{{GnB|Black}} owns an Electrode as seen in ''[[GB11|Gold and Black VS Team Rocket]]'' which he took from [[Team Rocket]].

[[Eusine]] also has an Electrode in the manga.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
[[Lt. Surge]]'s Voltorb battled against {{TP|Red|Clefairy}} and evolved into Electrode the same match.

Electrode also appeared in ''[[PM047|Squirtle, the Crybaby Pokémon]]'' under the ownership of {{OBP|Giovanni|Pocket Monsters}}. Multiple of them appeared in ''[[PM099|Stop the Strange Sonic Sound!!]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Electrode (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:Electrode SSBB.png|200px|thumb|An Electrode in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Melee|Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]/[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|3DS and Wii U]]===
In the original Smash Bros. Electrode would appear from the doorway atop the [[Silph Co.]] building on the [[Saffron City (stage)|Saffron City stage]] and use {{m|Explosion}}, damaging any players near it. In the sequels, it would be released randomly from a [[Poké Ball]]. When released, Electrode will pause for a few seconds before using Explosion. It can be picked up and thrown, though this is risky as Electrode will hurt everyone near it, including the player who threw the Poké Ball. Electrode functions in Brawl in much the same way as in Melee, however, sometimes, it will fail to explode. Other times, Electrode will merely pretend to fail to explode, then explode suddenly after a few seconds. Electrode appears in fourth installment, functioning the same as in Brawl.

====Melee trophy information====
''Electrode, an electric Ball Pokémon, is the evolved form of Voltorb. It has the tendency to explode with even the slightest provocation, which has earned it the nickname "Wrecking Ball." Electrode is the quickest Pokémon found to date, and its distinctive white-over-red coloring is the opposite of Voltorb's.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Ball Pokémon. The more electricity stored in its body, the quicker it moves. One danger of storing that much electricity is the slightest stimulus may cause it to explode. Moves it specializes in are {{m|Selfdestruct}} and {{m|Explosion}}. Its love of electricity cause it to gather near power plants."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
'''NA''': ''An Electric-type Pokémon that stores energy inside its body. Nicknamed "the Bomb Ball" by some, the slightest shock risks setting this Pokémon off. If you're feeling brave, you can throw Electrode at your foes before it detonates. Handle with care, or it'll go off in your hands instead! ''

'''PAL''': ''This Electric-type Pokémon stores huge amounts of electricity in its body. It is also known as the Bomb Ball due to the fact that even the lightest touch can make it blow up. Sometimes it takes a little while for Electrode to use its Explosion attack, so you might have enough time to throw it in someone else's direction! Feeling brave?''

==Trivia==
* In Red, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen, players can obtain an Electrode at a level as low as 3 by catching a {{p|Pikachu}} in [[Viridian Forest]], evolving it, and [[In-game trade|trading]] it to an old man on [[Cinnabar Island]].
* Electrode has a [[Oh Electrode|short song]] dedicated to it, sung by [[Suzukisan]].
* Electrode has the highest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.
* Electrode is the only non-playable Pokémon to use the same move in [[Pokkén Tournament]] and the [[Super Smash Bros.]] series.
* Electrode is the only Pokémon that can be permanently missed without battling, because the only place to catch them in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|s}} is [[Team Rocket's Castle]], which becomes inaccessible after defeating Giovanni. 

===Origin===
It seems to be based upon the concept of a living [[Poké Ball]], and is often mistaken for one. The design concept may be inheritance from the time when the franchise was known as [[Capsule Monsters]], as early artworks show Poké Balls without the button in the middle.

The idea of them being mistaken for the standard Item Balls is similar to a {{wp|Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic}}, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs.

Based on its Japanese name and its explosive tendencies, Electrode may have some connection to land mines. Like {{p|Voltorb}}, it may be based on {{wp|ball lightning}} as well.

====Name origin====
Electrode may be a portmanteau of ''electric'' and ''explode'' or ''node'' (a computer or program), as well as a pun on ''{{wp|electrode}}'', a device through which electrical currents pass (although such a device is usually in the shape of a rod.)

Marumine may be a combination of 丸 ''maru'' (circle) and ''{{wp|mine}}'', as in {{wp|landmine}}.
