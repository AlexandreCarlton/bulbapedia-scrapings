'''Spewpa''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コフーライ''' ''Kofuurai'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Scatterbug}} starting at [[level]] 9 and evolves into {{p|Vivillon}} starting at level 12.

==Biology==
Spewpa are small, insectoid Pokémon. They have a large, round head, which is light gray in the back with a darker gray face. There are two khaki-colored dots on their face, one above each eye. The face is bisected by a thin, black line that ends in a khaki-colored triangle at the top of the head. Spewpa have two ovular eyes that are the same color as their facial markings, and square black pupils and no visible sclera. Their body is covered with a white furry material, and there are red, black, and cream square particles surrounding it.

In order to defend itself, Spewpa will bristle its fur to threaten predators or spray powder at them.

==In the anime==

===Major appearances===
Multiple Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY012|To Catch a Pokémon Smuggler!]]'', which evolved from Scatterbug, including one of them that {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} helped out. One of the Spewpa later evolved into a {{p|Vivillon}} while battling with [[Dolan]]'s {{p|Diggersby}}, and the rest evolved afterwards.

Six Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY121|Seeing the Forest for the Trees!]]'' in the Winding Woods. Ash and {{AP|Greninja}} had to save them from freezing in a blizzard, and later ended up saving one of the Spewpa from falling off a cliff. This helped them to master the Ash-Greninja form. Afterwards, they all evolved into Meadow Pattern Vivillon. Two of them reappeared in a flashback in ''[[XY139|Facing the Needs of the Many!]]'' and ''[[XY140|Till We Compete Again!]]'' as Spewpa.

===Minor appearances===
Spewpa debuted in ''[[XY001|Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!]]''.

Three Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY084|Adventures in Running Errands!]]'', under the ownership of a {{pkmn|Trainer}}.

A Trainer's Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY138|The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!]]''.

==In the manga==

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
Two Spewpa were used by the [[Lumiose Press editor-in-chief]] in ''[[PAXY10|Pangoro Poses a Problem]]'', to stop X from protecting Alexa. With their Rage Powder, the Spewpa prevented X's Marisso and Salamè from listening to X's commands. Eventually, both were defeated, but X's Pokémon were left exhausted afterward.

Spewpa appears as a Poké Ball summon. It will use {{m|Stun Spore}} to temporarily stun any nearby opponents that attack it, but doesn't move otherwise.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Spewpa, the Scatterdust Pokémon. This Bug-type Pokémon can harden its body to protect against attacks. If attacked in Smash Bros., it'll bristle up and paralyze its opponent with Stun Spore. However, it won't do anything if you don't attack it. Don't mess with it—it won't mess with you. ''

'''PAL''': ''Spewpa, the Scatterdust Pokémon. This Bug-type Pokémon can harden its body to protect against attacks. In this game, it might bristle up and paralyse you with Stun Spore.

==Trivia==
* Spewpa and its evolutionary relatives are the only {{type|Bug}} Pokémon introduced in [[Generation VI]].
* Spewpa is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 213.

===Origin===
Spewpa is likely based on the larval forms of certain members of the ''{{wp|Tineidae}}'' family, such as the {{wp|Carpet Moth}} and {{wp|Case-bearing Clothes Moth}}, which construct snug cases of fibres and hairs that leave their heads exposed. Considering its evolutionary relatives, it may also represent a generic {{wp|pupa}} of a moth or butterfly, particularly {{wp|silkworm}} cocoons.

====Name origin====
Spewpa may be a combination of ''spew'' and ''{{wp|pupa}}''.

Kofuurai may be a combination of 小 ''ko'' (small) or 粉 ''ko'' (powder) and 風来人 ''furaijin'' (wanderer).
