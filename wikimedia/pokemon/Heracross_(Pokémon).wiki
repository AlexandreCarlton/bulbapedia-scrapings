'''Heracross''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヘラクロス''' ''Heracros'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Heracross''' using the [[Heracronite]].

==Biology==
Heracross is a bipedal, beetle-like Pokémon covered in a blue exoskeleton. There is a long, pronged horn on its forehead. The horn ends in a cross on the male and a heart-shape in the female. On either side of the horn is a short antenna with a spherical tip. Heracross has oval, yellow eyes. Its forearms have a pair of spikes near the wrists, while its thighs have a single spike each. It has two claws on its hands, and a single long claw on each foot. There is a single pair of wings covered by its carapace, which can been seen during its release from a Poké Ball in the 3D games.

Mega Heracross is bulkier than its previous form. Thin orange markings now rim its head, hands, and shoulders. Additionally, there is a half-circle, orange marking over its eyes. It now has a long, pointed nose that curves slightly upward. Its back now lacks wings and is completely yellow. The horn on its head has grown into a large, simple spike with two smaller spikes on the front. The antennae have lengthened as well, and now have ovoid tips. Mega Heracross's forearms have thickened and lost their spines. This Pokémon has a high body temperature, so it opens the shells of its arms and torso to allow heat to escape.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Heracross</ref>

Heracross's claws allow it to dig into the ground for sturdy footing or climb trees. Using its horn, it throws opponents or competitors for food. It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}, where it feeds on tree sap. As seen in [[EP119|the anime]], Heracross has been known to compete with Pokémon such as {{p|Pinsir}} for food. The same episode also shows Heracross allowing {{p|Butterfree}} to feed on tree sap after Heracross has finished its meal. In addition, it is shown to suck sap from {{type|Grass}} Pokémon such as {{p|Bulbasaur}}. In Alola, it has a rivalry with {{p|Vikavolt}}, but get along with {{p|Pinsir}} well, sharing a common enemy.

===Major appearances===
====[[Ash's Heracross]]====
Heracross debuted in ''[[EP119|A Sappy Ending]]''. Groups of {{p|Pinsir}} and Heracross were having a dispute due to the fact that {{TRT}} was siphoning all the tree sap from the Pinsir side of the forest. One Heracross decided to help {{Ash}} and his friends for this crisis. Ash captured Heracross at the end of the episode.

A Heracross appeared in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', under the ownership of [[Kato]]. It was used in a Tag Battle against [[Ash's Pikachu]] and [[Dawn's Piplup]] alongside [[Kiko]]'s {{p|Beautifly}}.

A Heracross that can Mega Evolve appeared in ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]'', under the control of [[Levi]] and [[Cherie]]'s Mega Wave. Heracross was briefly lent to [[Jessie]] to use in an attempt to capture {{OBP|Magearna|M19}}. It was later freed from their control when [[Alva]]'s Mega Wave Crystal was destroyed, and it escaped.

Heracross faced the Legendary Pokémon, but was easily swatted away, forcing Bugsy to switch to another tactic. He later uses him to battle [[Sabrina]] in the opening ceremonies of the [[Pokémon League]]. He initially overwhelmed her {{p|Mr. Mime}} due to his type advantage, but lost when he was tricked into using {{m|Endure}} just in time for her to use {{m|Encore}}.

==Trivia==
* Heracross can be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Pinsir}}, replacing {{p|Scyther}} in that role, which gained an evolution in Generation II. Both are {{type|Bug}} Pokémon based on beetles and lack an evolutionary family. Pinsir is not part {{t|Fighting}} like Heracross, but it learns several Fighting-type moves by leveling up. Both Pokémon and their [[Mega Stone]]s are versions exclusives in {{g|X and Y}}: Heracross and Heracronite are exclusive to Y while Pinsir and Pinsirite are exclusive to X. Each Mega Stone can be found in [[Santalune Forest]] in their respective versions. The heights of both Pokémon are the same, even when Mega Evolved.
* Mega Heracross has the highest base Attack stat of all Bug-type Pokémon.
* Mega Heracross is tied with {{me|Pinsir}}, {{me|Scizor}} and {{p|Genesect}} for the highest base stat total of all Bug-type Pokémon.
* Heracross is one of fourteen Pokémon that one could collect [[foreign Pokédex entries]] for in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.

===Origin===
Heracross is most likely based on the {{wp|Japanese rhinoceros beetle}}. These beetles are known for their incredible strength, and use in {{wp|insect fighting}}, which explains its {{t|Fighting}} type.

Mega Heracross appears to be based on a {{wp|Hercules beetle}}.

====Name origin====
Heracross and Heracros are a combination of Ἡρακλῆς, ''Hēraklēs'' ({{wp|Heracles}}, a demigod of Greek mythology, whose {{wp|Hercules|Roman mythological analogue}} has given name to the {{wp|Hercules beetle}}) and ''cross''.
