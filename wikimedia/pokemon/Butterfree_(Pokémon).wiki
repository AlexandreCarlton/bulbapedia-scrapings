'''Butterfree''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バタフリー''' ''Butterfree'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Metapod}} starting at [[level]] 10. It is the final form of {{p|Caterpie}}.

==Biology==
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resemble small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resemble long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of veined wings are white with black accents. The oval scales of a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but white in males.

Butterfree's wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. This powder repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to {{tt|six miles|ten kilometers}} from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by {{p|Heracross}}, as seen in [[EP119|the anime]]. Butterfree is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}, but has also [[EP021|been observed]] flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.

==Trivia==
<!--
DO NOT ADD TRIVIA ABOUT BUTTERFREE BEING RELATED TO VENONAT.
-->
* Butterfree was the first Pokémon shown in the {{pkmn|anime}} to have an alternate color, [[Pink Butterfree|pink]]. This has only been seen in a single female, and unlike a {{Shiny}} Butterfree, which has green eyes and pink wings, limbs, and snout, this Butterfree only differed in its pink body and wings.
* Butterfree has been trained by four important anime Trainers: {{Ash}}, [[Ritchie]], [[Solidad]], and [[Drew]].
* Butterfree shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Beautifly}}. They are both known as the Butterfly Pokémon.
* Butterfree can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Beedrill}}. Both of their unevolved stages evolve at level 7 and again at level 10. They both go through metamorphosis-like evolution and have the same base stat total of 395. Also, while Beedrill is [[Game-exclusive Pokémon|exclusive]] to {{game3|Black and White|Black|s}} and [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2|Black 2]], Butterfree is exclusive to White and White 2.

===Origin===
Its design appears to be based on the {{wp|Aporia crataegi|Black-veined White}} butterfly.

====Name origin====
Butterfree is a combination of ''{{wp|butterfly}}'' and ''free'', possibly referring to its ability to fly after being grounded for two evolutionary stages. In Japanese, the name may also derive from the word 振る ''furu'' (to flap, as in wings).
