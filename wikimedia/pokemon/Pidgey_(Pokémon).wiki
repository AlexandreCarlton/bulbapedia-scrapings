'''Pidgey''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ポッポ''' ''Poppo'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Pidgeotto}} starting at [[level]] 18, which evolves into {{p|Pidgeot}} starting at [[level]] 36.

==Biology==
Pidgey is a small, plump-bodied avian Pokémon. It is primarily brown with a cream-colored face, underside, and flight feathers. On top of its head is a short crest of three tufts. The center crest feathers are brown and the outer two tufts are cream-colored. Just under its crest are its narrow, brown eyes. Angular black marking extend from behind its eyes down its cheeks. It has a short, stubby beak and feet with two toes in front and one in back. Both its beak and feet are a grayish-pink. It has a short, brown tail made of three feathers.

Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction and homing instincts. It can locate its nest even when far removed from familiar surroundings. It is a docile Pokémon, and generally prefers to flee from its enemies rather than fight them. By flapping its wings rapidly, it can whip up dust clouds and create whirlwinds to protect itself and flush out potential prey. {{m|Gust}} and {{m|Feather Dance}} are its former [[signature move]]s. Pidgey is very common throughout its range and can often be seen in meadows and {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}. {{p|Ekans}} is a natural predator of Pidgey.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Pidgey was originally going to be named ''Pidge''.
* Pidgey shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Spearow}} and {{p|Natu}}. They are all known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, though Natu has also been called a Little Bird Pokémon.
* Pidgey is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 251.
* In the anime, Pidgey is erroneously depicted with four talons on each foot, as opposed to three.
* Pidgey has the shortest [[cry]] of any Pokémon, being only 0.181 of a second long.

===Origin===
Anatomically, Pidgey resembles a {{wp|Cedar waxwing}} or {{wp|House sparrow}} more than it does a {{wp|Columbidae|pigeon}}. However, there have been some references to Pidgey Mail, alluding to {{wp|homing pigeon}}s. Its category, "tiny bird," added to the sound of the end of its name, could suggest that Pidgey is also based on a {{wp|chickadee}}. However, it and its evolutions seem to have more traits related to {{wp|osprey}}s than pigeons or chickadees.

====Name origin====
Pidgey could be a corruption of ''{{wp|pigeon}}'' or a combination of that with the word ''{{wp|Budgerigar|budgie}}'' (a type of bird), ''{{wp|chickadee}}'' (a type of bird), or ''pudgy'' (referring to its plump physique).

Poppo appears to be the onomatopoeia of the sound a pigeon makes: ポッポッポ ''poppoppo''.
