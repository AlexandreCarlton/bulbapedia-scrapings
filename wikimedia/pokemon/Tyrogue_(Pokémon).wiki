'''Tyrogue''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バルキー''' ''Balkie'') is a {{type|Fighting}} [[baby Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into one of [[Hitmons|three different Pokémon]] starting at [[level]] 20:
* {{p|Hitmonlee}} if its {{stat|Attack}} is higher than its {{stat|Defense}}.
* {{p|Hitmonchan}} if its Defense is higher than its Attack.
* {{p|Hitmontop}} if its Attack and Defense are the same.

==Biology==
Tyrogue is a humanoid Pokémon with a predominantly pale purple body and brown hips and feet that resemble short pants and shoes. It has three blunt protrusions on top of its head, yellow eyes, and circular sections on each side of its head that resemble protective padding. There are white bands resembling bandages on its torso and wrists. It has thin limbs, and its hands have three fingers each. Tyrogue is a male-only species with no female counterpart.

Tyrogue is famous for its eagerness to compete and boundless energy, to such an extent that it will challenge anyone, even larger foes. Determined to make itself stronger, Tyrogue will not quit no matter how many times it loses. As a result, it is always nursing its injuries from fighting opponents larger than itself. As Tyrogue becomes stressed if it is not able to train every day, its {{pkmn|Trainer}} must maintain a regular training schedule. It is usually found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas.}}

===Major appearances===
Tyrogue debuted in ''[[EP233|A Tyrogue Full of Trouble]]''. He had been abandoned by his previous Trainer and left to fend for itself. As a result, he developed a hatred towards humans. Tyrogue ended up forming a gang of {{p|Mankey}} and {{p|Primeape}}, and together, they would steal from weary travelers, such as {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}. However, thanks to a {{tc|Black Belt}} named [[Kiyo]], who had been pursuing him, Tyrogue regained his trust of humans and ended up becoming his newest Pokémon.

In [[Pokémon GO]], Tyrogue evolves into {{p|Hitmonlee}} if {{stat|Attack}} is its highest {{IV}}, {{p|Hitmonchan}} if {{stat|Defense}} is its highest IV, or {{p|Hitmontop}} if {{stat|HP}} is its highest IV. If there is a tie for its highest IV, it evolves into one of the Pokémon corresponding to its highest IVs at random.

==Trivia==
* Tyrogue and {{p|Eevee}} are the only Pokémon that can [[List of Pokémon with branched evolutions|evolve into more than two Pokémon]].
* Tyrogue is the only [[baby Pokémon]] with a branched evolution.
* Tyrogue is the only baby Pokémon whose stats are all equal.
* If a Tyrogue is hacked into {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} before the [[National Pokédex]] is obtained, it will be able to evolve into {{p|Hitmonlee}} or {{p|Hitmonchan}}, but due to FireRed and LeafGreen preventing evolution into non-Generation I Pokémon, it will be unable to evolve into Hitmontop.
* Tyrogue is the only Pokémon whose evolution is determined by stats.
* While {{p|Hitmontop}} shares the [[Ability]] {{a|Steadfast}} with Tyrogue, Tyrogue is unable to retain this Ability after evolving. This is because Tyrogue's Steadfast is its second Ability, while Hitmontop's Steadfast is its Hidden Ability.
* Tyrogue has the lowest base stat total of all Fighting-type Pokémon.
** Tyrogue also has the lowest {{stat|HP}} and {{stat|Attack}} base stats of all Fighting-type Pokémon.
* Tyrogue is the only Pokémon that created a shared evolution family between two Pokémon that were previously unrelated.

===Origin===
It draws inspiration, especially in its most recent artwork, from wrestlers. The designs on Tyrogue's body resemble the uniform of most {{wp|scholastic wrestling}} teams—possibly showing its maturity as a fighter (a younger creature, while its evolutions seem more professional).

====Name origin====
Tyrogue is a combination of ''tyro'' (a beginner) or ''tyke'' (child) and ''rogue'' (one who is playfully mischievous). ''Ty'' may also be referring to {{wp|Mike Tyson}}.

Balkie may be a corruption of ''bulky''.
