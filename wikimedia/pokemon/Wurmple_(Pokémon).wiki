'''Wurmple''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ケムッソ''' ''Kemusso'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

Wurmple will [[Evolution|evolve]] into either {{p|Silcoon}} or {{p|Cascoon}} starting at [[level]] 7 depending on its [[personality value]]. As personality values cannot be influenced or seen by the player, what a given Wurmple will evolve into is essentially random. From there, the Silcoon or Cascoon will evolve again starting at level 10 into {{p|Beautifly}} or {{p|Dustox}} respectively.

==Biology==
Wurmple is a small, caterpillar-like Pokémon. Its body is mainly red with a cream underside and face. It has large yellow eyes with dark pupils. It has one sharp yellow stinger on its head and two of them on its rear. It has a tall, erect, red spine behind its forehead and a similar, smaller spine behind that. It has small spikes running down the top portions of its body and five pairs of stubby white limbs.

Wurmple has suction pads at the tips of its feet, which allow it to cling to glass or tree branches without slipping. It can spit a white silk that turns gooey when exposed to the air. It can release poison from its tail spikes, which can weaken and poison foes. Wurmple lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}. It eats leaves and pulls bark off trees to feed on the sap. {{p|Taillow}}, {{p|Swellow}}, and {{p|Starly}} are natural predators of Wurmple.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Wurmple is one of the members of [[Team Tasty]], alongside {{p|Swellow}}. A running joke is that Wurmple is terrified that Swellow is going to eat him, and that's why he named their team that. Only at the end of the game does Swellow realize this.

==Trivia==
* Wurmple shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Caterpie}}. They are both known as the Worm Pokémon.
* Wurmple is the only Pokémon whose branched evolutions evolve further. All other Pokémon with a branch in their evolutionary line either evolve once before the branch or do not have any other evolutionary event besides the one which is branched.
* Wurmple is the only Pokémon whose evolution is directly influenced by its [[personality value]]. Pokémon whose evolution is influenced by their [[gender]] are also technically evolving based on their personality value, although unlike Wurmple, their determined evolution can be known in advance.
* Prior to Generation VI, Wurmple's body style was [[File:Body02.png]].
===Origin===
Wurmple is based on a {{wp|caterpillar}}.

====Name origin====
Wurmple is a combination of ''{{wp|worm}}'' and ''rumple'' (referring to the wrinkled texture of its skin). The ending of Wurmple may also come from ''simple''.

Kemusso is derived from 毛虫 ''kemushi'' (caterpillar).
