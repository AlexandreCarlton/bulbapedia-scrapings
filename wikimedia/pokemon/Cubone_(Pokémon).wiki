'''Cubone''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カラカラ''' ''Karakara'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Marowak}} starting at [[level]] 28.

In [[Alola]], Cubone will evolve into [[Regional variant|Alolan]] Marowak when leveled up at [[Time|night]] starting at level 28.

==Biology==
Cubone is a small, bipedal Pokémon with a golden brown hide that covers most of its body, including both dorsal spikes. Its belly is a very light brown. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black eyes and a small area surrounding them. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. The small Cubone survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon. The bone allows it to learn {{m|Bone Club}} and {{m|Bonemerang}}, two moves [[Signature move|exclusive]] to Cubone and its evolution {{p|Marowak}}.

It is called the Lonely Pokémon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, as it was apparently traumatized by the death of its mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits "a plaintive and mournful sound." On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. It lives in rocky areas, usually on {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}} or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pokémon Tower in [[Lavender Town]] where deceased Pokémon were buried and mourned. {{p|Mandibuzz}} is a natural predator of Cubone.

''"A Lonely Pokémon. It wears its mother's skull as a helmet--for this reason, no one has ever seen its face. It sometimes sees its departed mother's face in the full moon, which causes it to grow sad and cry. The stains on the skull are tracks of its tears. When it cries, the skull shakes and emits a mournful sound. When it levels up, it evolves into Marowak."''

[[File:Bandai Cubone card.jpg|thumb|200px|Cubone's face partially revealed]]
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Cubone was originally known as "Orphon," a corruption of the word "orphan," based on its abandonment at birth.
* Cubone is [[Midori Harada]]'s favorite Pokémon.
* Cubone is one of the Pokémon that appears in the [[Pokémon 151]] clothing line.
* Cubone is the only Pokémon that can [[Evolution|evolve]] into a dual-[[type]] Pokémon that doesn't share any types with its evolution.
* A [[Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards|Japanese trading card]], which features Cubone using the move {{m|Growl}}, partially reveals Cubone's face.

===Origin===
Cubone may be based on a dinosaur. It also could be based on primitive cultures that wore bones for decoration and used them for weapons.

====Name origin====
Cubone may be a combination of ''cute'' and ''bone'', ''cub'' and ''bone'', or ''{{wp|Billiard ball|cue ball}}'' (a reference to its pale white head or that its bone resembles a billiards or snooker cue) and ''bone''. It could also be a combination of the Latin word ''cubo'' (recluse) and ''bone''; this can refer to its lonely nature.

Karakara may be taken to mean からから (clattering). It is worth noting that ''karakara'' denotes lighter clattering than がらがら ''{{p|Marowak|garagara}}''.
