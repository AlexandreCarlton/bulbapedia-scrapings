'''Machoke''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴーリキー''' ''Goriky'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Machop}} starting at [[level]] 28 and evolves into {{p|Machamp}} when [[trade]]d.

==Biology==
Machoke is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon covered in gray skin. It has a vaguely reptilian face with a short snout, narrow red eyes, and four pointed teeth visible inside its mouth. Two of these teeth are in the upper jaw, while two are in the lower jaw. On top of its head are three, light brown ridges. Its arms are muscular with dark red, vertical stripes on them. It possesses large pectoral muscles that protrude slightly over its belt. The lower part of its body has black markings that resemble briefs. It is always seen wearing a black and golden power-save belt resembling a Championship belt that regulates Machoke's strength.

Machoke is a Pokémon of immense strength. Its muscles are as hard as steel, and it is capable of lifting extremely heavy objects with only one finger. In spite of this, it is modest and often helps people with manual labor. It can be found in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}}, where it trains daily.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Machoke was originally known as "Kung-Foo". This name is a corruption of ''kung fu'', a Chinese martial art.
* In [[The Official Pokémon Handbook]], Machoke is described as being extremely narcissistic; "Machoke, [...]likes its own body way too much. Sometimes it's too busy looking at itself in the mirror to train", which is exactly the opposite of the description given in Pokémon Stadium; "Although it is incredibly strong, it is always modest".
* Machoke's belt looks very similar to the Winner's Belt Prop in {{game|Black and White|s}}.

===Origin===
Machoke appears to be based on a {{wp|bodybuilder}} or wrestler with some reptilian traits.

====Name origin====
Machoke may be a combination of ''macho'' ({{wp|Spanish (language)|Spanish}} for ''male'', ''overly masculine'' or ''chauvinist'') and ''choke''. ''Macho'' has come to mean tough or masculine in English. Akin to {{p|Mr. Mime}}, the masculine attribute has no reflection on gender assignment, as both species can be male and female; however, {{p|Machop}}'s evolutionary line does have a 3:1 male:female ratio, making the species predominantly—but not entirely—male.

Goriky is a corruption of 剛力 ''gōriki'' ({{wp|Hercules|herculean}} strength).
