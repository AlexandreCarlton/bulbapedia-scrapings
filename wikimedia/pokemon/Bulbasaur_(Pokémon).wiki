'''Bulbasaur''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フシギダネ''' ''Fushigidane'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Ivysaur}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Venusaur}} starting at level 32.

Along with {{p|Charmander}} and {{p|Squirtle}}, Bulbasaur is one of three [[starter Pokémon]] of [[Kanto]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].

==Biology==
Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker green patches. It has red eyes with white pupils and scleras. It also has pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head. Its snout is short and blunt, and it has a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.

As mentioned [[AG025|in the anime]], starter Pokémon are raised by {{tc|Pokémon Breeder|Breeder}}s to be distributed to new {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. [[EP102|It is known]] to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. [[PK01|Bulbasaur has also shown]] itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokémon and soothingly rocks it in the air.
It is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. [[EP051|It has been observed]] that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===
[[File:Shauna Bulbasaur.png|thumb|250px|Bulbasaur in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Bulbasaur]]=====
Ash's Bulbasaur debuted in ''[[EP010|Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village]]'' as one of the Pokémon in the [[Hidden Village]]. Though initially wary of {{Ash}}, the two eventually warmed up to one another, and Bulbasaur challenged him to a battle. Using {{AP|Pikachu}}, Ash won the battle, and Bulbasaur was caught. Unlike {{AP|Charmander}} and {{AP|Squirtle}}, which were caught in the two episodes following that of Bulbasaur, Bulbasaur remained in Ash's party until ''[[EP225|Bulbasaur... the Ambassador!]]'', when Ash sent him to {{an|Professor Oak}}'s [[Professor Oak's Laboratory|lab]] to work as an ambassador between otherwise argumentative groups of Pokémon.

=====[[May's Bulbasaur]]=====
Much later on, when Ash was traveling in the [[Hoenn]] region, his companion {{an|May}} caught her own Bulbasaur after being separated from the group in ''[[AG073|Grass Hysteria!]]''. It remained with her throughout the rest of her journey in Hoenn, helping her to win the {{ci|Purika}} {{pkmn|Contest}} and place Top 8 in the [[Hoenn Grand Festival|regional]] [[Grand Festival]]. When she traveled to [[Kanto]] to continue her journey with Ash in ''[[AG133|The Right Place and the Right Mime]]'', May, too, left her Bulbasaur at [[Professor Oak's Laboratory]] to learn from Ash's while she and Ash's group traveled throughout the Kanto region. May retrieved it during her travels in [[Johto]], where it evolved all the way into a {{p|Venusaur}}.

=====[[Shauna's Bulbasaur]]=====
{{an|Shauna}}'s starter Pokémon is a Bulbasaur she received from [[Professor Sycamore]]. It first appeared in ''[[XY039|Summer of Discovery!]]''. Shauna's Bulbasaur was revealed to have evolved into Ivysaur by ''[[XY090|Tag Team Battle Inspiration!]]''

=====Other=====
A Bulbasaur that used to belong to the [[Mayor of Trovitopolis]] appeared in ''[[EP102|The Mystery Menace]]''. In his childhood, the mayor abandoned his Bulbasaur and sent it into the sewers when it wouldn't evolve into {{p|Ivysaur}}. Aided by [[Misty]] and {{Tracey}}, Ash found the abandoned Bulbasaur while searching for his own, which had gone missing. After defeating the arrogant mayor and his personal SWAT team, Ash and company left the Bulbasaur, which had grown rather large in its time in the sewers, with [[Nurse Joy]].

In ''[[SS014|Journey to the Starting Line!]]'', {{OBP|Gilbert|SS014}}, the son of the mayor of [[Pallet Town]], was supposed to start his journey as a [[Pokémon Trainer]] with one of the three Kanto [[starter Pokémon]], but they were scared off by [[Ash's Tauros]]. {{an|Professor Oak}}, {{Tracey}}, {{Delia}}, and Gilbert set out to find them. The Bulbasaur was the last one to be found and it was stuck in a tree that was surrounded by a group of {{p|Primeape}}. In the end, Bulbasaur was the one that Gilbert decided to start with.

A Bulbasaur appeared in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

====Minor appearances====
Bulbasaur was mentioned in the first episode of the anime, ''[[EP001|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]'', as one of the three [[starter Pokémon]] new Trainers in [[Pallet Town]] can choose from. Ash dreamed of owning one, and it was his second choice of a starter, after {{p|Squirtle}}. However, when he arrived at Oak's lab, it was too late, as an unnamed Trainer who started the same day had already taken it.

Multiple Bulbasaur appeared in ''[[EP015|Battle Aboard the St. Anne]]''.

A Bulbasaur appeared in ''[[EP028|Pokémon Fashion Flash]]'', ''[[EP057|The Breeding Center Secret]]'', ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'' and ''[[BW116|The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!]]''.

A {{pkmn|Trainer}}'s Bulbasaur appeared in ''[[EP080|Friends to the End]]'', during the closing ceremonies of the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]].

==Trivia==
* In the Japanese {{game2|Red|Green|Blue}}, international {{game|Red and Blue|s}}, and Japanese {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, [[Professor Oak]] classifies Bulbasaur as the "plant Pokémon" (Japanese: しょくぶつポケモン) when the player is about to choose it as their {{pkmn2|starter}}, using the term while referring to its {{t|Grass|type}}. In the English versions of {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, he calls it the "grass Pokémon".
** This also occurs in the [[PO01|first episode]] of [[Pokémon Origins]].
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokemon.png|thumb|250px|right|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Bulbasaur as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Bulbasaur on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.
* Bulbasaur's evolution family is the only starter Pokémon evolution family to have each member appear at least once in the Super Smash Bros. series.
* Bulbasaur and its evolutions share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Sunkern}}. They are all known as the Seed Pokémon.
* Bulbasaur's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Fiore Browser number|Fiore Browser]] are the same: 001.
* Due to [[List of censored words in Pokémon Black and White Versions|the censor]] that prevents Pokémon with offensive [[nickname]]s being traded on the [[Global Trade System|GTS]], a Bulbasaur with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in {{game|Black and White|s}}.
* In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Bulbasaur is programmed to be able to learn {{m|Charm}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, but no other Pokémon in the {{egg|Grass}} or {{egg2|Monster}}s can legitimately learn it to pass down as an [[Egg Move]] in those games. In [[Generation III]] and {{gen|IV}}, Bulbasaur can inherit the move from {{p|Shroomish}} by chain breeding; in Generation V on, Bulbasaur can inherit the move directly from {{p|Cottonee}}.
* Bulbasaur may be part of the [[List_of_references_to_Pokémon_in_popular_culture|inspiration for the naming]] of ''{{wp|Bulbasaurus}}'', a genus of dicynodonts.<ref>https://www.inverse.com/article/27179-bulbasaurus-dicynodont-pokemon-dinosaur</ref>

===Origin===
Bulbasaur appears to be based primarily on some form of {{wp|reptile}} or {{wp|synapsid}}, specifically mammal-like synapsids known as ''{{wp|Dicynodont}}s'' from the {{wp|Permian}} period. Along with visible ears and no genuine metamorphosis stage (evolution aside), Bulbasaur appears to have more in common with {{wp|mammals}} than {{wp|amphibians}} such as {{wp|frogs}} and {{wp|toads}}, which metamorphose from one definite creature into another as they mature as opposed to just growing into a larger adult version of itself the way that Bulbasaur does. Alternatively, Bulbasaur's large rounded snout, wide mouth, wide-set eyes, blotch-patterned skin, and quadruped-like movements are vaguely similar to those of certain amphibians, such as the {{wp|common toad}}. Since Bulbasaur's "ears" do not in fact have hollows, they may actually be similar to the glands present behind the eyes of many species of frogs and toads.

The bulb on its back may resemble that of a {{wp|lily}} or {{wp|onion}}.

====Name origin====
Bulbasaur is a combination of ''{{wp|bulb}}'' (a rounded underground storage organ present in some plants, notably those of the lily family) and ''saur'' (Ancient Greek for ''{{wp|lizard}}'').

Fushigidane literally means "''isn't it strange?''" and is also a pun on<!-- the non-dictionary compound word --> 不思議種 ''fushigidane'' (mysterious bulb).
