'''Raikou''' (Japanese: '''ライコウ''' ''Raikou'') is an {{type|Electric}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Entei}} and {{p|Suicune}}, it is one of the [[Legendary beasts]] resurrected by {{p|Ho-Oh}} after the burning of the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]. Of the three Legendary beasts, Raikou is said to represent the lightning strike which ignited the fire that consumed the Brass Tower.

==Biology==
Raikou is a quadruped, yellow, tiger-like Pokémon with black stripes and a white underside. It has a thin, light blue tail with sharp angles and a spark-shaped formation at the end. Most of its face consists of thick, white fur and shorter yellow fur around its red eyes. Raikou's muzzle is a light blue "X" and it has a black faceplate with two bumps that covers its forehead, nose, and ears. Raikou has two long fangs that make its appearance similar to the {{wp|saber-toothed cat}}. Its large claws each converge to form a single point and never retract. Extra fur hangs off its body in front of its thighs. Raikou has a mane across its back that resembles dull purple rain clouds and allows it to shoot bolts of lighting.

[[SS023|As seen in the anime]], Raikou is able to fly by creating storm clouds. [[The Legend of Thunder!|It is shown]] to be distrustful of humans, though it may form some friendship with those who help it. Raikou tends to appear during thunderstorms and when other Electric-type Pokémon are in danger. Raikou races across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} while barking cries that sound like thunder.

=====Trophy information=====
''These Thunder Pokémon travel near and far, blasting out electrified whirlwinds. They carry storm clouds on their backs, so they can produce lightning regardless of the local weather; it's even said that they descended to the earth with via lightning bolts. Their extreme quickness lends itself to flight, so they're very hard to capture.''

Raikou appears as a trophy.

=====Trophy information=====
'''NA:''' ''Was that a bolt of lightning flashing by, on the ground instead of the air? Then it could have been Raikou. A rumble of thunder in the distance, but not a cloud in the sky? Sounds like Raikou's roar to us. It is said that this wild Pokémon perished in the Johto region once, but Ho-Oh was so filled with sorrow at the loss that Raikou was resurrected.''

'''PAL:''' ''If you see a bolt of lightning flash across the ground instead of from the sky, you may have just caught a glimpse of Raikou. And if you hear a peal of thunder that lasts longer than it should, that may be Raikou's roar. It's said that this wild yet majestic Pokémon once perished in the Johto region, but Ho-Oh, filled with sorrow, resurrected it.''

==Trivia==
* Raikou, along with {{p|Entei}} and {{p|Suicune}}, was designed by [[Muneo Saitō]].<ref>http://kai-you.net/article/5034</ref>
[[File:Raikou dex entry LoT.png|thumb|Raikou in {{jo|Jimmy}}'s Pokédex]]
* Raikou is the only Pokémon in the anime whose image on the anime [[Pokédex]] was of stylized art rather than [[Ken Sugimori]]'s official artwork.
* Raikou's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 1 Special Attack and 2 Speed is unique.
* Raikou's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] is the same: 243.

===Origin===
Raikou may be particularly based on the Thunder and Lightning gods of most cultures surrounding the world, mostly the 雷獣 ''{{wp|raijū}}'' (lit. thunder beast), a thunder demon of Japanese lore and is said to be Raijin's companion. It is said to be a creature that could take the form of a {{wp|tiger}}, {{wp|monkey}}, blue {{wp|wolf}} wrapped in lightning, and many other animals. Raikou is specifically based on its tiger form, while the Pokémon {{p|Manectric}} is based on its wolf form.

In terms of physical build, Raikou may be based on the ''{{wp|Smilodon fatalis}}'', a well-known but extinct species of wildcat often referred to as a saber-toothed tiger. Its color and pattern scheme are reminiscent of that of a {{wp|Bengal tiger}}. The stripes that decorate Raikou's body also can be compared to zigzagging thunderbolts and perhaps even scars from claws. The white ruff around Raikou's face is akin to the {{wp|Siberian tiger}}'s thick fur around its neck. In the anime, Raikou is shown to be very agile, swift, stealthy, and a powerful attacker, just like a tiger. The gray "plate" atop its head may be similar to Entei's head ornament, being either a helmet or crown that signifies courage and power.
The flowing purple mane on its back is likely meant to invoke the image of a {{wp|cumulonimbus cloud}}, the cloud type most often associated with thunderstorms.

====Name origin====
Raikou could be taken to mean 雷光 ''raikou'' (lightning), which is also the inspiration for the name of {{wp|raijū}}, or it may be a combination of 雷 ''rai'' (thunder) and 皇 ''kō'' (emperor). It may also derive from 雷公 ''raikō'' (thunder duke), the on'yomi reading of {{wp|Lei Gong}}, a Taoist/Daoist deity.
