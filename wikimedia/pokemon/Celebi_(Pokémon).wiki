'''Celebi''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''セレビィ''' ''Celebi'') is a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Grass}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It serves as the guardian of [[Ilex Forest]] and is only able to be caught from the wild in {{game|Crystal}} with an event activated by the [[GS Ball]].

Celebi is the last Pokémon in the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] and [[List of Pokémon by Hoenn Pokédex number (Generation III)|Hoenn Pokédex]] in [[Generation III]], although in the latter, Celebi is not shown.

==Biology==
Celebi is a green fairy-like creature. It has round toeless feet, three-fingered hands, and clear wings on its back. It has a round head that comes to a curved point. It has large baby-blue eyes with thick black rings around them, and a pair of green antennae with blue tips.

Often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}, Celebi is a Mythical Pokémon, known in legend as the "Voice of the Forest." It is able to travel through time and exist simultaneously throughout time, and plant life flourishes wherever it has been. [[M04|As seen in the anime]], it is able to bring deceased Celebi back to life and restore plants to perfect health. It was shown in [[Pokémon Colosseum]] that Celebi has the power to instantly cause the [[Purification]] of any [[Shadow Pokémon]] and can be summoned at [[Relic Forest]] with the melody of a [[Time Flute]]. Despite living in forests as its guardian, Celebi only shows itself in areas and times of peace. It has been regarded that as long as Celebi are seen throughout the world, a prosperous and bright future is still in store for the Pokémon World.

==Other appearances==
[[File:Celebi SSBB.png|220px|left|thumb|Celebi in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When a [[Poké Ball]] is thrown, there is a 1 in 251 chance of Celebi appearing after all these requirements have been fulfilled:
* Unlock all 25 characters
* Unlock all 29 stages
* Beat all 51 events
* Unlock the score display (by reaching 5000 KOs)

It does not affect the battle, but the thrower of the [[Poké Ball]] will earn a bonus and trophy of Celebi.

====Trophy information====
''"Celebi has the power to travel through time, and thus wanders from one age to the next. It is considered a deity by the forests: plants and trees are said to grow in unimaginable abundance wherever Celebi visits. Like Mew, Celebi is a Pokémon shrouded in mystery. Its special techniques blend grass and psychic powers."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
When a Poké Ball is thrown, there is a 1 in 493 chance of Celebi appearing. Like the other "secret" Pokémon, it drops collectible items; in Celebi's case, it drops trophies.

====Trophy information====
''"A Time Travel Pokémon. Celebi can travel throughout time and inhabit multiple places simultaneously. It is said that it appears only during times of peace, greeted by a flourishing of grass and trees. Two turns after Celebi uses its {{m|Future Sight}} move, the foe is bombarded with psychic energy. This proves to have a devastating impact on any Pokémon."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]===
Celebi appears as a trophy.
====Trophy information====
''This Pokémon has the unique ability to travel through time to the past or future. However, the only times Celebi wants to visit are those of peace, so catching sight of Celebi in one of the beautiful forests it frequents is a good sign indeed. Perhaps it's mankind's responsibility to create the kind of time Celebi would want to visit.''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}}: Celebi is in a [[Ranger Net]] mission. In the mission, the player must capture the Celebi to save it from the [[Go-Rock Squad]]. It is found wandering in [[Lyra Forest]].
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: [[Celebi (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)|A Shiny Celebi]] is a supporting protagonist in the main storyline. When the player and partner are sent to the future by {{mdc|Dusknoir|2}}, the player, partner, and {{mdc|Grovyle|2}} work together to get back to the past. Celebi was the Pokémon who sent Grovyle and the player to the past before, and the trio receive her help to go back again.
* [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]]: Celebi is the first boss of the game and a main Pokémon in the storyline. It has the power to [[time travel]] and can send the player (without the [[Ukulele Pichu]]) into the past. It can also send specific Pokémon to the present if the player uses the correct [[Ranger Signs]].
* [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]]: A regular Celebi appears with {{p|Ampharos}} and {{p|Jirachi}} of the [[Expedition Society]] to transport the player and partner out of harm's way before {{p|Nuzleaf}} and {{p|Beheeyem}} get a second chance to petrify the player and partner after their return from the [[Voidlands]]. Celebi explains that [[Dark Matter]] once threatened to attack the Tree of Life which would have resulted in the planet's collision with the sun, but was stopped by the efforts of a human and a Pokémon. Celebi theorizes this same human was brought back to the present by the ancient {{p|Mew}}. Celebi also reveals that the Harmony Scarves worn by the player and partner were made using materials from the Tree of Life; their temporary evolutions were triggered as a result of the Tree's power. Later, Celebi helps assist many other Pokémon in stopping the ascent of the Tree of Life into the sun a second time. It, along with the Shiny Celebi from Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky, are recruitable after completion of the main story via the Connection Orb.

==Trivia==
* Celebi was the only Pokémon of the 100 [[Generation II]] Pokémon that wasn't used in [[Pokérap GS]].
** However, it was used in the [[Hoenn Pokérap]] along with Mew, another Pokémon that wasn't used in its own generation's Pokérap.
* During the main story of {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}, {{mdc|Celebi|2}} is referred to as a female, while it is genderless in the core series as well as on the Mystery Dungeon status screen.
** Also, this Celebi is the first [[Shiny Pokémon]] to appear in the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series]].
** A different non-shiny Celebi appears in {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, who is referred to as a male.
* A 2008 [http://www.pokebeach.com/news/0708/second-pokemon-interview-with-masamitsu-hidaka-many-interesting-points interview] done with [[Masamitsu Hidaka]] revealed that the [[GS Ball]] was initially meant to contain a Celebi that would be used in a story arc throughout the Johto series. This idea was shelved, however, and {{OBP|Celebi|M04}} became the star of ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]''.
* Celebi is the only Pokémon whose number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by New Pokédex number|New Pokédex]] are the same: 251.
* According to a dead Nintendo of Japan page from the early 2000s, Celebi's Japanese name was initially romanized as ''Selbi'' as opposed to the later ''Celebi''.<ref>[http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n07/selbi/ Nintendo of Japan page]{{dead link}}</ref><ref>[http://www.math.miami.edu/~jam/azure/forum/tuff/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=7;t=001003 The Azure Heights Forum: How to get Serebii] (thread from March 2001, containing a link to the aforementioned Nintendo of Japan page)</ref>
* Celebi was the first event-exclusive Pokémon to appear in an episode of the anime.

===Origin===
Celebi has a natural theme.<ref>[http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=203 Hidden Power of Masuda: Director's Columns]</ref> Celebi might be related to the nature worship of {{wp|Shinto}}ism. It may be based on a {{wp|fairy}}, {{wp|dryad}}, or ''{{wp|Kodama (spirit)|kodama}}''.

====Name origin====
Celebi may be a combination of ''{{wp|celestial}}'' and ''being'', or it may be a combination of ''serenity'' and 美 ''bi'' (beauty).
