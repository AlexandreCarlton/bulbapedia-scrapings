'''Articuno''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フリーザー''' ''Freezer'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Zapdos}} and {{p|Moltres}}, it is one of the three [[Legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]].

==Biology==
Articuno is a large avian Pokémon with predominantly blue plumage and large wings said to be made of ice. It has a head crest that consists of three, darker blue rhombus-shaped feathers on its forehead and circular red eyes. Its beak is short and gray, and its long, thin legs are the same color. It has a long, streamer-like tail that is longer than its body and the same shade of blue as its crest.

When Articuno flaps its wings, it can chill the moisture in the air around it, making snow fall. It flies from icy mountain to icy mountain. According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in [[EP189|the anime]], Articuno sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety. Articuno lives in cold, {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|isolated locations}}, such as mountain peaks.

===In the Ash & Pikachu manga===
{{main|Noland's Articuno}}
Noland's Articuno appears in ''[[SP33|Off To The Battle Frontier!!]]''.

===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Legendary birds (M02)|Articuno (M02)}}
Articuno plays a major role in the second [[Pokémon movie]], ''[[M02|The Power of One]]''. Likewise, it appears in the {{ma|Mirage Pokémon Lugia's Explosive Birth|manga adaptation}} of the film by [[Tanigami Toshio]].

===In the Magical Pokémon Journey manga===
[[File:Articuno MPJ.png|thumb|250px|Articuno in [[Magical Pokémon Journey]]]]
Articuno appears in the eighth chapter of the Magical Pokémon Journey manga, ''[[PPP08|The Legendary Articuno!]]''. In ''The Legendary Articuno!'', there is an Articuno atop a mountain used by a ski resort. This Articuno is rumored to spirit away the lives of lost travelers, but in reality, it is a friendly Pokémon that runs a Snowcone shop. {{MPJ|Pikachu}}, {{MPJ|Clefairy}} and {{MPJ|Jigglypuff}} enter a Snowcone-eating contest at Articuno's shop, and Articuno also rescues an injured [[Hazel]].

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Legendary birds (Adventures)#Articuno|Articuno (Adventures)}}
Articuno first appeared in ''[[PS025|You know... Articuno!]]'' where it was being chased by several Team Rocket Grunts. It is shown to seal itself in a block of ice when it senses the presence of an enemy. It strongly dislikes confrontation. However, in [[Pokémon Adventures volume 3]], [[Team Rocket]] was able to temporary get hold of it, together with {{p|Moltres}} and {{p|Zapdos}}. It was used by the then-Rocket Executive [[Koga]] to try to finish {{adv|Red}} and {{adv|Blue}} and succeeded in freezing them, but that turned out to be a strategy to let the ninja master's guard down and attack him from behind when [[Blue's Charizard]] unfroze them. After his defeat, it is called upon by [[Sabrina]]'s {{p|Kadabra}} with Zapdos and merged to form {{DL|Legendary birds (Adventures)|Thu-Fi-Zer}}, a combination that proved almost unstoppable until [[Saur]], the {{p|Ivysaur}} it knocked out of the wall, saved its Trainers with a web created using {{m|Vine Whip}} and evolved to {{p|Venusaur}} to deliver the final blow with Charizard and [[Blasty]]. It at last regains its freedom after the defeat and splits from its fellow birds.

Much later, in the {{chap|Gold, Silver, & Crystal}}, it reappears under {{adv|Green}}'s possession with its fellow birds and is lent to Red in the battle against [[Will]] and [[Karen]], who nearly overwhelmed the three with {{p|Ho-Oh}} and {{p|Lugia}}. Since it has not been seen since, it has either been kept in the box or released, its true status unknown.

===In the Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga===
Falkner has an Articuno which debuted in ''[[GB03|The Legendary Pokémon Appears!]]''. It went up against {{GnB|Gold}}'s {{p|Pikachu}} after it came from another time.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
Articuno debuted in ''[[PM012|Will You Risk Your Life To Play The Magic Game?!]]'' and was caught by {{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} in the [[PM013|next chapter]].

===In the Pokémon Zensho manga===
[[Blaine]] catches an Articuno with {{Zensho|Satoshi}}'s help.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Articuno (TCG)}}

==Merchandise==
Articuno was one of the first four Pokémon designs revealed when the [[Pokémon 151]] brand was first announced. In the shirt design, an Articuno is rising out of the right side with the number 144 on its chest.

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Articuno will use a {{m|Blizzard}} attack that freezes any opponent that is caught in it for a few seconds.

====Trophy information====
"''Clouds gather, the barometer plunges, and fresh snow falls from the frigid air when this [[legendary Pokémon]] takes wing. Graceful and elegant, it boasts long tail feathers that flap in the wind and are lovely to behold. As would be expected, its combat moves are based on its cold nature; they include {{m|Ice Beam}} and {{m|Blizzard}}.''"
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]===
Articuno reappears as a trophy.
====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''The air around Articuno is always cool, and it can make snow fall on even the hottest of days. It must be the perfect Pokémon to have around in summer! Then again, do you really want to be the one to use a Legendary bird Pokémon as an ice machine? Let's just think this through for a minute. ''

'''PAL''': ''The air around Articuno is always cool, and it can make snow fall on even the hottest of days. It must be the perfect Pokémon to have around in summer! Then again, do you really want to be the one to use a Legendary Bird Pokémon as an ice machine? You'd just get the cold shoulder from the whole Pokémon community. ''

==Game data==

==Trivia==
* In the [[EP002|second episode]] of the anime, there is an engraving on a wall in the Viridian City Pokémon Center that depicts the [[Legendary birds]]. Ash mistakes the Articuno engraving as {{p|Ho-Oh}}. While the blue coloration of the stone indicates the {{t|Ice}} type, and the wings and crest feathers are those of Articuno, the multiple tail feathers look nothing like Articuno's tail, being more similar in appearance to those of Ho-Oh.
* In {{3v2|Red|Blue|Yellow}}, as well as {{2v2|FireRed|LeafGreen}}, there are binoculars in the [[gate]] separating [[Fuchsia City]] from {{rt|15|Kanto}}, through which Articuno can be seen flying toward the sea. In a lapse of continuity, or possibly due to oversight by the designers, it is still visible in the binoculars even if it is captured or defeated in the [[Seafoam Islands]].
* In the opening of ''[[EP188|Spring Fever]]'', {{Todd}} points out a tall mountain that is Articuno's home. This mountain is, on the outside, the same as [[Ice Island]], Articuno's home in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]''.
* In {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}, it is the only one in its trio that cannot be encountered unless the player enters an event password.
** Also, it is the only {{t|Ice}} Pokémon in IQ group C.
* Articuno was the last [[Generation I]] Pokémon to be introduced in the anime, and the only one that did not appear in Season 1, if movies and banned episodes are included ({{p|Mew}} is the last if its appearances in movies are not counted).
* Articuno is the only Pokémon other than {{p|Smeargle}} and {{p|Poliwrath}}{{tt|*|Only in Generation II}} that is able to learn an accuracy-focusing move and a [[OHKO]] move, learning {{m|Mind Reader}} and {{m|Sheer Cold}}. An Articuno using this combination can be fought in the [[Battle Subway]].

===Origin===
This Pokémon's appearance may be based on the {{wp|Simurgh}}, deriving from the Persian رخ {{wp|Roc (mythology)|rokh}}, which is that of a giant arctic bird. Also, its long tail and small body may be reference to the rare bird, the {{wp|quetzal}}. It is also anatomically very similar to the {{wp|White-throated Magpie-jay}}.

===Name origin===
Articuno is a combination of ''arctic'' (far northern regions of the globe) and ''uno'' ({{wp|Spanish language|Spanish}} for ''one'', indicating that it is the first in the series of [[Kanto]] [[Legendary birds]]).

Freezer is literally ''freezer'' (that which freezes).
