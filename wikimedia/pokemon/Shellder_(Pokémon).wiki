'''Shellder''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''シェルダー''' ''Shellder'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Cloyster}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]].

==Biology==
Shellder is a black pearl-like Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. It has an enormously long red tongue, which it uses to burrow itself into sand and to lure and capture prey. Its body is known to be soft and tender; however, its shell is said to be harder than diamond. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by {{p|Omastar}}. Once ensnared by Omastar's tentacles, its hard shell stood no match to the Spiral Pokémon's deadly powerful bite, and its soft insides quickly devoured.

Shellder can develop a symbiotic relationship with {{p|Slowpoke}}. After attaching itself to the Dopey Pokémon's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and together evolve into {{p|Slowbro}}. If it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a [[King's Rock]], the two will instead evolve into {{p|Slowking}}. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and obtain a new stage in its life cycle.

Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.

While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns.

Shellder has two former [[signature move]]s. It can shoot spears of ice by using {{m|Icicle Spear}}, or clamp tightly to its opponents using {{m|Clamp}}. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|sea floor}} home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. {{p|Kingler}}, {{p|Omastar}}, {{p|Rufflet}}, and {{p|Bruxish}} are natural predators of Shellder.

==Trivia==
[[File:Slowking evolution anime.png|thumb|Shellder and {{p|Slowpoke}} evolving into {{p|Slowking}} in ''[[EP260|A Crowning Achievement]]'']]
* In the anime, Shellder is required to evolve {{p|Slowpoke}} into {{p|Slowbro}} or {{p|Slowking}}. Shellder clamps onto a Slowpoke's tail to evolve into Slowbro, or onto its head while wearing the [[King's Rock]] to evolve into a Slowking. Even though Shellder changes form drastically when it bonds with Slowpoke to evolve (see above), it is not considered an evolution in and of itself.
* In the episode ''[[EP066|The Evolution Solution]]'', it is revealed that Shellder is still capable of speech as the shell of a Slowbro.
* Shellder were shown to be capable of floating through the air in {{g|Snap}}, a trait that has been seen in no other media.
* Shellder and {{p|Cloyster}} share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Clamperl}}. They are all known as the Bivalve Pokémon.

===Origin===
Shellder is similar to the {{wp|clam}}, with its tongue representing a clam's "foot." The fact that it latches onto Slowpoke and produces a beneficial toxin may be inspired by {{wp|leech}}es.

====Name origin====
Shellder is derived from ''shell'' and possibly ''shelter'', referring to the fact that it lives in a shell.
