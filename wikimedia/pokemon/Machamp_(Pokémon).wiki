'''Machamp''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイリキー''' ''Kairiky'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Machoke}} when [[trade]]d. It is the final form of {{p|Machop}}.

==Biology==
Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. Its skin is bluish gray, and it has red eyes and pale yellow lips. On its head, there are three, brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs along with a golden power-save belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes.

Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs at once. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought. Machamp can be found living in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains.}}

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Machamp was originally known as "Ju-Doh". This name is a corruption of ''judo'', a fighting style.
* Machamp could be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Alakazam}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary family, both were introduced in [[Generation I]], they reach their final stage by [[trading]], and they both have a 75% male gender ratio. Also, Alakazam excels at the {{stat|Special Attack}} stat, while Machamp excels at {{stat|Attack}}. Moreover, a girl in [[Oreburgh City]] will [[List of in-game trades#Diamond Pearl and Platinum|trade]] her Abra in exchange for a Machop.
** Machamp also can be seen as a counterpart to the {{p|Conkeldurr}} evolutionary line. Both of them are {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon whose Attack is their highest stat. They both have below average speed. They share the same base stat total. They both have same gender ratio, they both have three-evolutionary stages, and they both reach their respective final-evolutionary stage through [[Trade|trading]].

===Origin===
Machamp appears to be based on a {{wp|bodybuilder}} or wrestler. Seeing as it has more than two arms and blue skin, Machamp might also be based on a Hindu god, perhaps {{wp|Shiva}} or {{wp|Vishnu}}.

====Name origin====
Machamp may be a combination of ''macho'' ({{wp|Spanish (language)|Spanish}} for ''overly masculine'' or ''chauvinist'') and ''champion''. ''Macho'' has come to mean tough or masculine in English. Akin to {{p|Mr. Mime}}, the masculine attribute has no reflection on gender assignment, as both species can be male and female; however, {{p|Machop}}'s evolutionary line does have a 3:1 male:female ratio, making the species predominantly—but not entirely—male. The name may also incorporate the term ''{{wp|Mach number|Mach}}'', referring to the high speeds at which Machamp can dole out its powerful punches.

Kairiky is a corruption of 怪力 ''kairiki'' (superhuman strength). It is worth noting that ''kairiki'' is the Japanese name of {{m|Strength}}.
