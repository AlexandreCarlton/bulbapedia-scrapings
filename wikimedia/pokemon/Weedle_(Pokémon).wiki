'''Weedle''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ビードル''' ''Beedle'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Kakuna}} starting at [[level]] 7, which evolves into {{p|Beedrill}} starting at level 10.

==Biology==
Weedle is a small larva Pokémon with a segmented body ranging in color from yellow to reddish-brown. Combined with its red nose and feet, Weedle's bright coloration wards off its enemies. Weedle has a conical, two-inch (five centimeter) venomous stinger on its head and a barbed one on its tail, but its other body parts are spherical.

Weedle can retaliate against attackers and those who step on it with its strong toxin. It can distinguish its favorite kinds of leaves using its acute sense of smell. As a young Bug Pokémon, its daily appetite for leaves matches its weight. Weedle can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}} and usually hides in grass, bushes, and under the leaves it eats.

==Trivia==
[[File:Kokana.png|thumb|100px|Weedle's early design, Kokana]]
* Weedle has the lowest base stat total of all {{type|Poison}} Pokémon.
** In addition, Weedle is tied with five other Pokémon for having the lowest Special Defense stat of all Pokémon, and has the lowest Special Defense of both {{type|Poison}} and {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
** Weedle is also tied with [[Gastly]] for having the lowest base {{stat|Defense}} of all Poison-type Pokémon, as well as being tied with [[Ledyba]] for having the lowest base Defense of all Bug-type Pokémon.
* Until {{v2|Platinum}}, Weedle was completely incapable of dealing damage to {{type|Steel}} Pokémon—outside of {{m|Struggle}}—because it could only learn {{m|Poison Sting}}, to which Steel types are immune. From Platinum onward, Weedle can learn {{m|Bug Bite}}.
* An {{DL|List of unused Pokémon and character designs|Kokana|early design}} of Weedle's sprite was shown on Game Freak's official Japanese website.
* Prior to Generation VI, Weedle's body style was [[File:Body02.png]].
* Weedle was [[List of references to Pokémon in popular culture|the inspiration for the naming]] of ''Stentorceps weedlei'', a species of wasps. Both Weedle and ''Stentorceps weedlei'' exhibit the distinctive feature of having a spine in the middle of the organism's head.<ref name="Real-life taxonomic influence">[http://www.waspweb.org/Cynipoidea/Figitidae/Eucoilinae/Stentorceps/Stentorceps_weedlei.htm ''Stentorceps weedlei'' Nielsen & Buffington]</ref>
* Weedle is the only Pokémon that cannot legitimately know any {{type|Normal}} moves.

===Origin===
Weedle appears to be based on the {{wp|larva}} of a {{wp|wasp}} or {{wp|hornet}}. Weedle's red nose and legs resemble spots that appear on the larvae of some species of wasp or hornet.

====Name origin====
Weedle is likely a combination of ''{{wp|worm}}'' and ''needle'', referring to the stingers on its body. It may also be a corruption of ''{{wp|weevil}}'', another sort of bug.

Beedle is a combination of ''{{wp|bee}}'' and ''needle''.
