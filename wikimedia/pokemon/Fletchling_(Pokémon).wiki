'''Fletchling''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤヤコマ''' ''Yayakoma'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Fletchinder}} starting at [[level]] 17, which evolves into {{p|Talonflame}} starting at level 35.

==Biology==
Fletchling are small, avian Pokémon similar in appearance to robins. They have a reddish-orange head with a triangular yellow mark on the back of each eye. Their body and wings are gray, and there are white tips on the wings. They have long, black tail with a white 'v'-shaped marking near the tip. The tail ends in two points, and has two feathers sticking out at the base, giving the impression of the fletching on the end of an arrow. Their legs, beak, and eyes are black. The legs are thin and spindly, with two toes facing forward and one pointing backward on each foot.

Fletchling are said to be very friendly and are well known for their beautiful songs. They communicate by using chirps and moving their tail-feathers to signal one another. In spite of their typically peaceful disposition, they are relentless in battle and very territorial, attacking perceived threats mercilessly. Its body is warm, and doubles in temperature when it is excited.

==Trivia==
* Fletchling is the only regional bird Pokémon to have its primary type changed upon evolution.
* Fletchling was designed by [[Saya Tsuruta]].

===Origin===
Fletchling is based on a {{wp|Japanese robin}}. Its tail design and name might suggest that it was based in part on an arrow.

====Name origin====
Fletchling may be a combination of ''{{wp|fletching}}'', ''{{wp|fledge|fledgling}}'', and ''{{wp|hatchling}}''.

Yayakoma may be a combination of 矢 ''ya'' (arrow), 稚児 ''yayako'' (baby), and 駒鳥 ''komadori'' ({{wp|Japanese Robin}}).
