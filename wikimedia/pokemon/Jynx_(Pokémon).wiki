'''Jynx''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ルージュラ''' ''Rougela'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Smoochum}} starting at [[level]] 30.

==Biology==
Jynx is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon that resembles a woman. Jynx wears a red gown that hides its feet and has white arms with purple hands. There are golden circles on the chest area of its gown. Jynx has a purple face, pink lips, saucer-like eyes, and long blonde hair. Originally, its face was colored black, causing {{DL|Pokémon controversy|Jynx|controversy}} in the United States due to its perceived racial insensitivity. Jynx is a female-only species with no true male counterpart.

Jynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. It puts its enemies to sleep using its signature move, {{m|Lovely Kiss}}. Jynx often is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}}.

==In the anime==

===Major appearances===
Jynx debuted in ''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]''. One of [[Santa Claus]]'s Jynx was separated from him. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} helped to return the Jynx to her owner.

[[Lorelei|Prima]] owns a Jynx. She used her to send {{TRT}} flying in ''[[EP099|The Mandarin Island Miss Match]]''.

A [[Nurse Joy]] in [[EP250]] owned a Jynx, rather than a {{TP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}}. In this [[Banned episodes|banned episode]], {{an|Brock}} almost kissed this Human Shape Pokémon during his sickly state.

A Jynx was used by [[Erica]] in the [[Pacifidlog Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]] in ''[[AG115|Mean With Envy]]'' and ''[[AG116|Pacifidlog Jam]]''. ''Mean With Envy'' also marked the first appearance of Jynx's purple redesign in the anime.

A trio of Jynx sisters were in ''[[AG168|Three Jynx and a Baby!]]''. These three Jynx were overly-protective towards their sister, a {{p|Smoochum}}. The Smoochum evolved into a Jynx at the end of the episode.

===Minor appearances===
A Jynx appeared in ''[[EP090|Stage Fight!]]'', under the ownership of the [[Pokémon Showboat]] stage show staff.

A Jynx appeared in ''[[EP108|Pokémon Double Trouble]]'', running on a treadmill in a scene removed from the English dub.

A Jynx was used by a {{pkmn|Coordinator}} in ''[[AG013|All Things Bright and Beautifly!]]'', but this scene was cut from the English dub as it featured Jynx in its original design.

A Jynx appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''.

==In the manga==

[[File:Lorelei Jynx Adventures.png|thumb|left|200px|Jynx in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Magical Pokémon Journey manga===
{{main|Jynx (MPJ)}}
A fortune-telling Jynx appears in the manga [[Magical Pokémon Journey]]. {{MPJ|Arbok}} goes to Jynx's fortune-telling hut to find out if he has a chance with his crush, {{MPJ|Wigglytuff}}.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
Jynx debuts in ''[[PS017|The Jynx Jinx]]'' under the ownership of [[Team Rocket Elite Trio|Ken]]. She is used to attack Red and Green after they trick Team Rocket and take Mew. When she attacks Mew, Red and Green try to defend it, only to be defeated. Mew retaliates against her and freezes her and Ken while sparing Red and Green.

Most notably, there is a Jynx under the ownership of [[Lorelei]] which first appeared in ''[[PS068|Jigglypuff Jive]]''. Lorelei's Jynx is noted for having the ability to generate voodoo dolls out of ice using its {{m|Ice Beam}}. When Lorelei draws crosses on any part of the dolls using her lipstick, ice shackles form on the specified body parts of her targets, eventually freezing the victim over completely. Even after the victims have broken free, the freeze induces lasting numbness in the areas where it was applied. Both {{adv|Red}} and [[Sabrina]] suffer this condition and have to seek a cure atop [[Mt. Silver]] by bathing in the hotsprings there. Another ability of Lorelei's Jynx is revealed in the [[Sevii Islands]] saga: she can create a wispy band of ice around targets, which Lorelei can use to track them down using her powder case.

Later a Jynx appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to help during the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
A Jynx took part in a baseball match with {{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} in ''[[PM021|Fierce Competition at the Pokémon Baseball Tournament!]]''.

===In the Pokémon Gotta Catch 'Em All manga===
Shū has a Jynx in the [[Pokémon Gotta Catch 'Em All]] manga.

==Trivia==
[[File:Jynx Foot.png|thumb|right|200px|Jynx's foot]]
*No Pokémon have the same [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|type combination]] as Jynx and its pre-evolution, {{p|Smoochum}}.
* As its Pokédex entries state that Jynx speaks an incomprehensible language, the player, as a Pokémon, cannot understand anything it says in the {{pkmn|Mystery Dungeon series}}.
* When Jynx faints in the {{g|Stadium series}}, everything but its hair vanishes, implying that its armor and black "skin" is darkness. Similarly, in {{pkmn|Colosseum}} and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness|XD]], it simply vanishes upon fainting.
* Although Jynx has been seen to possess feet in the anime, it does not have a [[footprint]].
** When Jynx is viewed from underneath via the 3D-rendered Pokédex in the Stadium and {{pkmn|X and Y}} games, nothing but darkness is shown underneath its dress.
* A [[Capsule Monsters]] [[Media:Capsule Monsters Buhi.jpg|concept sketch]] depicts an unused Pokémon design with the same Pokédex number as Jynx.
* Jynx has the longest [[cry]] of any Pokémon, lasting 2.238 seconds.
* Jynx's sprite in the Virtual Console re-release of {{pkmn|Yellow}} is technically impossible for a [[Game Boy Color]] game. Its Virtual Console sprite contains five different colors (black, white, red, yellow, and purple), but actual Game Boy Color games can only store up to four colors per sprite (the original sprite used black, white, red, and yellow).

===Controversy===
[[File:124Jynx OS anime.png|thumb|right|Jynx's original design in the anime|150px]]
{{wp|Carole Boston Weatherford}}, a cultural critic, claimed that Jynx, which appeared in ''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]'', was a negative racial stereotype of African-Americans in an article titled "Politically Incorrect Pokémon" on the magazine ''Black World Today''. She chiefly compared Jynx to the racist characters in ''{{wp|The Story of Little Black Sambo}}'', and further compared Jynx to {{wp|Mr. Popo}} of the {{wp|Dragon Ball}} franchise, a character who is also potentially offensive in his design.

Weatherford's complaint caused many repercussions in the Pokémon franchise. The sprites of Jynx in the Western releases of {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}} were edited, and [[EP250]] was cut from international airings of the anime. A sequence depicting Jynx in its original design in ''[[AG013|All Things Bright and Beautifly!]]'' was also cut from the dub. Jynx's design was officially revised by [[Game Freak]] to be purple rather than black, including in Japan and South Korea; this change was reflected in later [[core series]] games (starting with {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}) and in the [[Pokémon anime]] starting in ''[[AG115|Mean With Envy]]''. Although the manga is colored in black-and-white, Jynx appearing in [[VIZ Media]]'s reissues of [[Pokémon Adventures]] are recolored as a dark gray rather than a straight black, suggesting that they are purple instead of black. It is also recolored to purple on the back cover of the reissue of {{PAV|4}}. The [[Virtual Console]] versions of {{g|Snap}}, {{ga|Pokémon Trading Card Game}}, and international {{game|Yellow}} also recolor Jynx's face. Jynx was recolored in the ending credits of [[PK01]] and [[PK04]] for the 2012 Japanese Blu-ray release. A recolored version of ''Holiday Hi-Jynx'' aired in Japan and is available on the Japanese [[Amazon Video]] and [[Netflix]]. Since 2014, English language DVD releases do not include ''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]'', ''[[EP090|Stage Fight!]]'', and ''[[EP099|The Mandarin Island Miss Match]]'', which all feature Jynx in its original design.

In recent years, some fans of Pokémon have noted that Jynx may be inspired by {{wp|ganguro}}, a Japanese fashion where women tan heavily, bleach their hair, and apply large amounts of makeup, instead of a black stereotype. This theory is mainly based on Jynx's long, straight, blonde hair, a common attribute of ganguro fashion. Another theory is that Jynx is based on the Nordic goddess {{wp|Hel}}, who was often depicted has having a face half white-half black and who ruled {{wp|Niflheim}}, primarily depicted as a land of primordial ice and cold. Some fans say this is supported by Jynx sharing traits with the iconic opera singing "{{wp|It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings|Fat Lady}}," who is pop-culturally portrayed dressed as the {{wp|valkyrie}} {{wp|Brünnhilde}}. Another possible origin is {{wp|Yama-uba}}, the mountain Crone.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Jynx}}
What Jynx is based on is a controversial topic within the fandom, although common interpretations are a Nordic or a Viking woman (possibly {{wp|Hel (goddess)|Hel}}, goddess of the underworld), or ''{{wp|ganguro}}'' (face-black). Also, the fact that Jynx are depicted as Santa's helpers in the anime may reference the folklore character {{wp|Zwarte Piet}}.

Jynx also has the traits of a female opera singer, especially the iconic cartoon depiction of the {{wp|It ain't over till the fat lady sings|fat lady}}; {{g|Snap}} and its third generation sprites depict it singing, especially the Emerald sprite that animates it singing a high note. Jynx may also have origins in the Japanese spirits known as {{wp|Yuki-onna}}, who lack feet, akin to Jynx's feet being covered by its dress.

It may also be based on {{wp|Yama-uba}} (also called Yamanba), a {{wp|yōkai}} which is described as always wearing a tattered red kimono, having whitish-blonde hair, control over snow, dark-colored skin, and large lips, traits which are evident in Jynx. "Yamanba" is also a slang for the extreme end of ganguro fashion, which involves bleached hair, artificial tanning, and heavy applying of brightly-colored lipstick.

Its revised coloring may be based on purple discoloration of the skin, a common symptom of {{wp|frostbite}}. This fits with Jynx's {{t|Ice}} type and how it is found in very cold places.

====Name origin====
Jynx is a corruption of ''{{wp|jinx}}'', a curse or hex of bad luck.

Rougela may be a feminized corruption of ''{{wp|Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge}}'', a type of makeup and also the French word for ''red''.
