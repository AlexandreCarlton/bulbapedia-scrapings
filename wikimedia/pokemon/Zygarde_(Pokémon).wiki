'''Zygarde''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ジガルデ''' ''Zygarde'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Ground}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VI]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it has the following three [[List of Pokémon with form differences|Formes]], which all retain Zygarde's Dragon/Ground typing:
* '''Zygarde 10% Forme''', one of the Formes introduced in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon}}
* '''Zygarde 50% Forme''', the Forme introduced in {{pkmn|X and Y}}
* '''Zygarde Complete Forme''', one of the Formes introduced in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon}}

Along with these Formes are two basic components of Zygarde: '''Zygarde Cores''', which act as the brains of Zygarde, and '''Zygarde Cells''', which compose Zygarde's Formes and cannot think. Neither Zygarde Cores nor Zygarde Cells can use [[move]]s or are useful in battles by themselves. Both of these components were introduced in Pokémon Sun and Moon. They can be collected using the [[Zygarde Cube]].

Zygarde 50% Forme was introduced in Pokémon X and Y. Zygarde Cell, Zygarde Core, Zygarde 10% Forme, and Zygarde Complete Forme were announced in the October 2015 issue of [[CoroCoro]] magazine. The remaining forms were introduced in Pokémon Sun and Moon. Prior to their appearance in Sun and Moon, Zygarde's other forms played an important role in the {{pkmn|anime}}'s ''[[XY series|XY&Z]]'' arc.

It is part of the [[aura trio]] with {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Yveltal}}.

==Biology==
Zygarde 50% Forme has a serpentine body with green and black markings. Most of its back is black, while the underbelly and the tip of its tail are green. Its eyes are comprised of four green hexagons, similar to an insect with compound eyes. Across the back of its neck is a large frill made of five long, flat protrusions. There are three short tendrils on either side of its chest, and its tail ends in five tendrils. It has many small, green hexagon markings on its body that can glow. This form of Zygarde is thought to monitor those who destroy the ecosystem from deep with its cave. Should the region's ecosystem fall into disarray, it will appear and reveal its power.

Zygarde 10% Forme has a relatively small, mostly black canine body with a green "leash" that continues beyond the neck. Its muzzle is black at the top and green elsewhere. Its eyes are white hexagons with a black outline and no discernible pupils; directly above the eyes are two small green hexagons that resemble eyebrows. On its forehead is a very thin, white ellipse. Its "leash" is entirely green with a small red hexagon connected to the bottom. Its left front paw is green up to the elbow, while all its other legs are completely black. On each of its legs are hexagonal protrusions, all the same color black as the legs themselves. There are two such protrusions on the back of its elbows, one on each knee, and two on each hip. One extension on the right hip is placed higher than on the left.

Zygarde Complete Forme has a large, humanoid body with a long tail similar to Zygarde 50% Forme's body. There are several flat protrusions around its head and triangular protrusions around its neck, giving it a crown-shaped appearance. On its face are three white hexagonal marks: one in the middle of its forehead with a line through it and two being that acting as eyes. There are an additional five green hexagons on its face: four along the bottom and one in the middle of a short protrusion on top. Each shoulder has two wings protruding from it. These wings all have a hexagon and an undulating pattern: blue on the right side and red on the left. The very tip of the wings can open up, making them appear to be a pair of "mouths" with red or blue patterns on the inside. It has multiple white protrusions on its body: three on each hand acting as claws, one on each knee, and one and the front of each foot. Additionally, there are green extensions surrounding its wrists and two under the white protrusions on its knees and feet. Its abdomen has a vertical, hexagonal pattern upon it with two thin, white, and vertical marks on either side. Across its chest is thin, zigzagging opening that fades between five colors: red, orange, white, cyan, and blue. The chest can open, revealing five cores of each color. Above this opening are two large green, hexagonal marks. When its wings and tail are extended, Zygarde Complete Forme resembles the Latin alphabet letter Z.

Zygarde Core is the brain of Zygarde, and has a small and leafy-green gelatinous body comprised of a large, round head, a moderately sized body, and a thin, hook-shaped bottom section that may be a tail. Its head is rounded except for a protruding, beak-shaped area at the bottom front. Within its head is a single, oval eye that has a smaller, oval pupil within it. Beside this eye is another white, semi-elliptic shape, possibly a second eye. Within its midsection is a nearly regular, red hexagon. Zygarde Cells make up every other part of Zygarde, and appears very similar to the Zygarde Core. Unlike the Core, it is flat, has a green pupil, and has a darker green, more elongated hexagon within its midsection. Unlike the Cores' hook-like bottom section, the Cells have a long and more noticeably tail-like back-end.

[[File:718Zygarde-Cell.png|thumb|100px|Zygarde Cell art]]
Each of Zygarde's Formes is made up of Cores and Cells. Neither of these two forms have power to battle alone, only when combined to form Zygarde. The Cores have their own will and are sometimes able to act on their own. They serve as brains for Zygarde. The Cells form the rest of Zygarde's body. They are only able to act on the Core's orders.<ref>http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde's-cores-and-cells/</ref> A single Core acts as the brain for the 10% form. This allows it to take action separately from Zygarde's 50% Forme, which comprises its main body, but only for a short time.<ref>http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-10-forme/</ref> Zygarde Complete Forme contains separate Cores for each of its wings and its tail, and each Core can make decisions and act independently of the others.<ref>http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-complete-forme/</ref>

Each form of Zygarde has its own special abilities and methods of attack. The Cores are able to communicate with other Cores and Cells via telepathy. The Cores have been known to take action when the local ecosystem is threatened. Its 10% Forme has razor-sharp teeth and can reach speeds up to 60 mph (100 km/h). Zygarde Complete Forme is said to exceed both Xerneas and Yveltal in power, possessing 100% of its total cells. Zygarde only enters Complete Forme when the ecosystem is under threat and the Cores decide that 50% Zygarde is unable to deal with it.<ref>http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/see-new-zygarde-formes-in-animation-news-from-japan/</ref>

As seen in the anime, the green on Zygarde's body turns red when it is under the control of [[Team Flare]]. This is presumably because it is being used for disrupting order, rather than maintaining it. 

Zygarde is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Land's Wrath}}, {{m|Thousand Arrows}}, {{m|Thousand Waves}}, and {{m|Core Enforcer}}.

===In the main series===
[[File:Z2 50 Percent Forme.png|thumb|250px|Zygarde 50% Forme in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Squishy]]=====
Zygarde is a major target of [[Team Flare]] in the anime. Zygarde Cells and one of its Cores made their anime debuts in ''[[SS035|Mega Evolution Special IV]]''. Thanks to the help of [[Mairin]]'s {{p|Chespin}}, [[Chespie]], the Core managed to escape [[Lysandre Labs]], and came across {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} in ''[[XY094|From A to Z!]]''. {{an|Bonnie}} was immediately taken with the unidentified Pokémon, and [[nickname]]d it "[[Squishy]]". It traveled in Bonnie's bag, alongside {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}}.

Squishy later transformed into 10% Forme after being separated from Bonnie and the others to defend itself against [[Bryony]] and her subordinates; Squishy, however, eventually returned to travel with Bonnie in ''[[XY103|A Cellular Connection!]]''.

In ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]'', it first transformed into 10% Forme when battling [[Alva]]'s Mega Evolution Pokémon Army. Later in the movie, when Alva used his laser weapon onto the [[Azoth Kingdom]], it transformed into its Complete Forme to protect the kingdom.

Squishy is known by the code name '''Z1''' by Team Flare.

=====[[Z2]]=====
A Zygarde known by the code name '''Z2''' by Team Flare appeared as a 50% Forme Zygarde in ''[[XY094|From A to Z!]]''. It managed to escape Team Flare by using {{m|Land's Wrath}}. It appeared as a Zygarde Core during ''[[XY102|Meeting at Terminus Cave!]]'', being contacted by [[Squishy]].

Unlike Squishy's red core, Z2 has a blue core.

=====Other=====
A Zygarde appeared in ''[[SS036|The Legend of X, Y, and Z!]]'' during a flashback, where it was seen in its 50% Forme.

====Minor appearances====
Zygarde Cells made their main series debut in ''[[XY094|From A to Z!]]''. They have appeared on occasion to assist Squishy and Z2.

Zygarde's Complete Forme made its main series debut in ''[[XY098|Dream a Little Dream from Me!]]'', where it appeared in a dream.

A Zygarde appeared in its 50% Forme in the opening sequence ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]''.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Zygarde (Adventures)}}
Zygarde debuts in ''[[PAXY29|Hawlucha Attack]]''. It was first mentioned by {{adv|Blue}}, who aimed to find it in order to stop the endless battle between {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Yveltal}}. It appeared in person at [[Anistar City]], where it was sought after by [[Emma|Essentia]], who aimed to capture it for Team Flare. When {{adv|X}} and {{adv|Y}} battle Essentia in order to retrieve Y's stolen Xerxer, Zygarde appeared before them and attacked before Essentia manages to successfully capture it.

Zygarde is later used by Essentia to battle against X, {{adv|Blue}}, and [[Blaine]]. After Emma is freed from [[Lysandre]]'s control, she was about to order Zygarde to attack him but he manages to take its Poké Ball making it fully under his control. Zygarde is later used to fight against X's [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]] team, but as the battle progresses Emma notices green blobs falling off of it. At that moment, Xerneas and Yveltal are returning into their dormant forms, causing it to disintegrate, and X hits it with a combined attack from his team. This resulted in Zygarde exploding into millions of green blobs, and Lysandre begins to fall. Soon after the battle ended, Blue and Blaine visited Sycamore and mentioned to him about seeing a little green silhouette after Zygarde disintegrated into the blobs. Sycamore reveals to them that similar green silhouettes, which he dubs Zygarde Cells, have been spotted in a far away region as well, and sends [[Dexio]] and [[Sina]] to investigate them in Alola.

A Zygarde Core appeared in the {{chap|Sun & Moon}}.

===Origin===
Zygarde's 10%, 50%, and Complete Formes may be inspired in part by the three children of {{wp|Loki}} and {{wp|Angrboða}}: {{wp|Fenrir}}, {{wp|Jörmungandr}}, and {{wp|Hel (being)|Hel}}.

Zygarde 10% Forme may be based on Fenrir. The green leash-like object around its neck could be based on {{wp|Gleipnir}}, the rope that binds Fenrir. This Forme could also draw inspiration from {{wp|Garmr}}, the watchdog that guards {{wp|Hel (location)|Helheim}}'s gate. In appearance, Zygarde 10% Forme resembles a {{wp|Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher}}.

Zygarde 50% Forme's appearance is based on a serpent in the shape of the letter Z. It may also draw inspiration from {{wp|Jörmungandr}}, a sea serpent that encircles the earth, and {{wp|Níðhöggr}}, a dragon that gnaws at the roots of {{wp|Yggdrasill}}, the world tree. Its flat shape and wriggling movement may be inspired by the {{wp|tsuchinoko}}, a Japanese cryptid, and its snakelike appearance may be inspired by {{wp|nāga}}, a class of snake entities in South and Southeast Asian cultures.

Zygarde Complete Forme may be based on {{wp|Hel (being)|Hel}}, the ruler of {{wp|Hel (location)|Helheim}}, the realm of the dead in Nordic myth. The colors on Complete Forme's chest match the colors of the real-world {{wp|flag of France}}, the country which inspired the [[region]] of [[Kalos]], as well as the main colors of {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Yveltal}}, the version mascots of X and Y.

Zygarde Cell and Zygarde Core may be based on cells as well as single-celled organisms such as {{wp|flatworm}}s (specifically {{wp|Planarian|planaria}}), {{wp|slime mold}}s and members of {{wp|Euglena}}. Some planarians' {{wp|ocelli}} also resemble eyes, which may have inspired the designs for the Cell and Core Zygarde. The hexagons within them may represent a {{wp|cell nucleus}}.

====Name origin====
Zygarde comes from the letter {{wp|Z}}. It may also be derived from ζυγωτός ''zygōtos'' (Greek for ''joined''), ''zygote'', ''garde'' (French for ''guard''), ''midgard'' (Old Norse: ''Miðgarðr''), or {{wp|Sigurd}}.
