'''Cosmog''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コスモッグ''' ''Cosmog'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Cosmoem}} starting at [[level]] 43, which evolves into either {{p|Solgaleo}} or {{p|Lunala}} starting at level 53 depending on the game it evolves in.

==Biology==
Cosmog is a small Pokémon with a gaseous body similar to a {{wp|nebula}}. It has two wisp-like extensions that serve as arms and an ellipse running down its body. Its front and back are black in color. It has yellow eyes and two blue cheeks. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it.

Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it, as well as open [[Ultra Wormhole]]s, but only when under stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time. Cosmog is theorized by the [[Aether Foundation]] to be a type of [[Ultra Beast]], and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation.<ref>http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-ca/pokemon/cosmog/</ref> Cosmog can be created by {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}.

As seen in the [[SM044|anime]], whenever Cosmog cries it emits a high-pitch scream.
