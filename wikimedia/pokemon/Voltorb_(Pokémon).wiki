'''Voltorb''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ビリリダマ''' ''Biriridama'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Electrode}} starting at [[level]] 30.

==Biology==
Voltorb is a spherical Pokémon that looks like a [[Poké Ball]] with a face, minus the button. The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. It was first seen in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. Voltorb is generally found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|power plants}} and other areas with electric fields. It has a volatile temperament, and will explode if bumped or agitated.

==Trivia==
* In the English and European versions of {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, a game called [[Voltorb Flip]] is introduced in place of [[slot machine]]s. The game is similar to Minesweeper, and largely focuses on flipping over cards to multiply the coins currently earned. Some cards, however, have Voltorb on them which will cause the player to lose [[coin]]s when flipped.
* Voltorb has the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
It seems to be based upon the concept of a living [[Poké Ball]] (with its {{Shiny}} coloration possibly being based on a [[Great Ball]]). The design concept may be inheritance from the time when the franchise was known as [[Capsule Monsters]], as early artworks show Poké Balls without the button in the middle.

The idea of them being mistaken for the standard Item Balls is similar to a {{wp|Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic}}, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs.

Given its tendency to explode, it could also be based on a bomb. Its unpredictable tendency to explode, as well as its shape and name, may be a reference to {{wp|ball lightning}}.

====Name origin====
Voltorb is a combination of ''volt'' and ''orb''.

Biriridama may be a combination of ビリビリ ''biribiri'' (sound of electric shock) and 玉 ''tama'' (sphere).
