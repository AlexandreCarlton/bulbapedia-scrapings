'''Lugia''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ルギア''' ''Lugia'') is a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is often considered to be part of the [[Tower duo]] with {{p|Ho-Oh}}, even sometimes as Ho-Oh's polar opposite. {{game3|Gold and Silver|Silver|s}} represents Lugia as "guardian of the seas", and {{game3|Gold and Silver|Gold|s}} represents Ho-Oh as "guardian of the skies." Lugia is also the [[trio master]] of the [[Legendary birds]].

Lugia is the [[game mascot]] of {{game3|Gold and Silver|Pokémon Silver|s}}, its remake {{game3|HeartGold and SoulSilver|Pokémon SoulSilver|s}}, and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]] (as [[Shadow Lugia]]), appearing on the boxart of them all.

In {{Pokémon XD}}, Shadow Lugia, codenamed '''XD001''', is a main part of the storyline, and [[Cipher]]'s ultimate [[Shadow Pokémon]].

==Biology==
[[File:Lugia plates.png|thumb|left|201px|Lugia folding back its plates]]
Lugia is a large Pokémon that resembles a dragon, a plesiosaur, and a bird. It is primarily pale silver-white, but it has blue undersides with slightly varying tones. It has a ridged mouth similar to a beak, although it has pointed teeth on its lower jaw. Its head has a point to the back, and Lugia’s eyes have pointed blue or black spikes on them. Lugia has a long, slender neck and a smooth, streamlined body. Dark blue or black plate-like protrusions run down the length of its back, and there are two smaller, more pointed ones on the end of its tail. It can fold back these plates to increase its speed. It has large wings that resemble hands. Though it is genderless, {{jo|Silver|a young Lugia}} has been observed, suggesting that there is a breeding population. [[EP220|Lugia has been shown]] to be fiercely protective of its young.

Lugia leads the [[Legendary birds]]. When they fight over territory, Lugia is the only Pokémon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, as observed in the [[M02|second Pokémon movie]]. Much like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. It is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear down cliffs. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as 40 days. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. Lugia is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] that learns {{m|Aeroblast}}. It is extremely {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rare}} and is hardly ever seen.

==In the anime==

===In the main series===
[[File:Hoopa Lugia.png‎|thumb|250px|Lugia in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====

=====[[Lugia (M02)]]=====
A Lugia was featured in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', central to the legend of [[Shamouti Island]]. Its psychic powers allow it to communicate with humans.

=====[[Silver (Johto)]]=====
A parent Lugia and its child (nicknamed Silver by [[Oliver]]) lived near [[Silver Rock Isle]] in the [[Whirl Islands]]. [[Dr. Namba]] attempted to capture both the parent Lugia and Silver for {{an|Giovanni}} in ''[[EP220|The Mystery is History]]'', ''[[EP221|A Parent Trapped!]]''. and ''[[EP222|A Promise is a Promise]]''. The series pays mention of the Lugia that was seen in the Orange Islands, with both [[James]] and {{Ash}} stating that it was "like" the one they had seen in the Orange Islands. In both versions, Ash first refers to the baby Lugia as a "mysterious Pokémon".

====={{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Lugia|Lugia (anime)}}=====
Lugia saved Ash, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} from being sucked into a whirlpool in ''[[EP210|Around the Whirlpool]]''. It later turned out to be the mother of {{jo|Silver}} in ''[[EP220|The Mystery is History]]''.

=====Other=====
A Lugia appeared in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', where it was the first [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned by {{an|Hoopa}} to protect it and Ash from the shadow [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound]]. After a battle, the shadow Hoopa eventually transported it back to its home in the sea using a portal.

A Lugia is set to appear in [[M21|the twenty-first movie]].

====Minor appearances====
A Lugia appeared in a [[Team Rocket]] fantasy in ''[[DP143|An Egg Scramble!]]''.

Lugia made a brief cameo appearance in the opening sequences of ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'', ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]'', ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', and ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
[[File:Masked Man Lugia.png|thumb|200px|Lugia in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
The [[Masked Man]] apparently caught Lugia twice (its plucked feather item [[Silver and Rainbow Wings|Silver Wing]] is shown under his possession several years ago, only to be stolen by {{Adv|Green}}), but both times it went back to the wild along with {{p|Ho-Oh}}.

The [[Elite Four|Kanto Elite Four]] tried to exterminate humans using Lugia, which appeared as a spirit, in ''[[PS089|The Might of... Metapod?!]]'' of {{PAV|7}} of the {{chap|Yellow}}. It was encountered as a being of shimmering light, when [[Lance]] summoned it to aid his schemes. After they were defeated, it flew to the [[Johto|west]]. It wasn't until much later in ''[[PS145|Sandslash Surprise]]'' that it was properly identified as Lugia. It was battled by the Johto dexholders, in ''[[PS146|Lively Lugia I]]'',''[[PS147|II]]'' and ''[[PS148|III]]'', where it was captured by The Masked Man just before Crystal's attempt.

Besides the two, it was also controlled for some time by [[Will]] and [[Karen]] while they were under the Masked Man's jurisdiction.

===In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga===
Lugia makes a brief appearance at the end of the chapter ''[[ET20|Epilogue: Wild Type]]''.

==Other appearances==
[[File:Lugia SSBB.png|thumb|Lugia in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]/[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Lugia will fly up out of the stage and return in the background, where it unleashes a powerful {{m|Aeroblast}} on the stage.

====Melee trophy information====
''The waters of the [[Whirl Islands]] are home to this legendary Pokémon, whom very few have seen. Lugia live quietly in the deepest ocean trenches for one very good reason: its combined aerial and psychic powers are so strong as to be extremely dangerous. The special moves of this gargantuan creature include the destructive wind assault known as Aeroblast.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Diving Pokémon. A legendary Pokémon often referred to as 'guardian of the seas,' it has the impressive ability to control the wind. Lugia typically spends its time quietly at the bottom of the ocean. Highly powerful in all areas, Lugia's Aeroblast move is especially powerful. It uses strong flapping of its wings to target damage on a foe's weak spot."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Despite being a Psychic/Flying-type Pokémon, Lugia sleeps on the ocean floor. Legend says the flapping of Lugia's wings can create storms that last up to 40 days. It's impossible to know for sure, but in Smash Bros., Lugia definitely brings a storm with its Aeroblast attack.''

'''PAL''': ''Despite being a Psychic- and Flying-type, Lugia sleeps on the ocean floor. It's said that if it were to flap its wings on waking up, it could cause a storm lasting 40 days. No one can say whether that's true or not, but Lugia's attacks certainly make it seem so. It flies behind the stage and creates a mighty gust of wind with its Aeroblast attack. ''

==Trivia==
<!-- Please do not add trivia referring to the episode of E.R. which mentioned Lugia. That belongs on the page: "List of references to Pokémon in popular culture," not here. -->
* Lugia is the only Legendary Pokémon to be part of [[Viz Media]]'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} DVD series.
* Before the introduction of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Lugia was known as "Pokémon X." In the {{pkmn|anime}}, [[Dr. Namba]] also refers to Lugia as "Pokémon X."
**Perhaps coincidentally, it also is known by its codename, '''X'''D001, in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness—also long before its true identity is revealed.
* In {{2v2|Gold|Silver}}, Lugia, like {{p|Ho-Oh}}, has the same encounter music as normal [[wild Pokémon]]. The same was true for the [[Legendary beasts]] before they received unique encounter music in {{v2|Crystal}}. However, Lugia and Ho-Oh got their own unique battle themes in {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}.
* Despite not being a {{t|Water|Water type}}, Lugia has occasionally been depicted as a {{ct|Water}} in the [[Lugia (TCG)|Trading Card Game]].
* Lugia is tied with Ho-Oh for the [[List of Pokémon by base stats|highest base]] {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* In the book adaptation of ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', Lugia is mistakenly referred to as a {{2t|Water|Flying}} type Pokémon.
* Lugia's [[Generation IV]], {{Gen|V}}, and {{Gen|VI}} Pokédex entries that mention it being able to cause a 40-day storm may be a biblical reference to {{wp|Noah's Ark}}.
* When Lugia's Shiny form is shown in {{g|Stadium 2}}, it is green rather than pink.

===Origin===
Lugia's aquatic tendencies could relate it to {{wp|plesiosauria|plesiosaurs}}. It is also possible that Lugia may be based on ''{{wp|Ryūjin}}'', a dragon who lived on the ocean floor and was the Shinto god of the sea. The two have similarities in mythology, and Lugia's Shiny colors (red and white) are the same colors as the coral {{wp|Ryūgū-jō|''Ryujin'''s palace}} was made of. In addition, it is worth noting that dragon (yang, male, water) and phoenix (yin, female, fire) duality is prevalent in Eastern mythology, and Ho-Oh clearly resembles a phoenix. Lugia's avian body, coloration and face-markings suggests that it may be somewhat based on the {{wp|grey heron}}. The {{wp|beluga whale}}, a white whale with a similar body shape and coloration to Lugia, may also be a basis for Lugia's design and name. Lugia's back fins and tail spikes are reminiscent of the ''{{wp|Stegosaurus}}''.

====Name origin====
Lugia may be derived from ''{{wp|lutetium}}'' (a silverish element), which in turn is named after ''Lutetia'' (the Roman name for {{wp|Paris}}, the city of light). It may also involve ''Lugeo'' (Latin for ''to lie dormant'', alluding to the way Lugia lies at the bottom of the sea) and ''luna'' (Latin for ''moon''). Alternatively, it may come from ''beluga whale''. It may also incorporate ''deluge''.
