'''Virizion''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ビリジオン''' ''Virizion'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Fighting}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Keldeo}}, Virizion is a member of the [[Swords of Justice]].

==Biology==
Virizion is a stag or {{wp|antelope}}-like, quadruped Pokémon that is primarily green. On the sides of its head are long horns that end in dull, curled points. It has a pointed snout with a black blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. Its face, hind legs, and underside are white. There is a pinked-tipped leaf on each side of its neck, and leafy tufts on its shoulders. On its back, there are pointed tufts of fur forming a medium-long tail. Its lower legs resemble knee-high boots with pink highlights at the knees, and it has black hooves.

Like the other members of [[Swords of Justice|its quartet]], Virizion battled against humans in order to protect Pokémon. Its horns are as sharp as blades, and are used to cut opponents.

{{spoilers}}
{{main|Virizion (Gates to Infinity)}}
[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity]]: {{mdc|Virizion|gti}} is a very popular Pokémon among the [[Post Town]] inhabitants, even though she has turned them all down at some point. The {{player}} first meets her after rescuing {{mdc|Dunsparce|gti}}. Dunsparce had gotten lost looking for a crystal to give to Virizion as a gift, because he wanted to be her friend. Virizion turns him down, saying she doesn't have friends. This hurts Dunsparce's feelings, causing him to run away. After rescuing Dunsparce again, she asks to join the team. The player's partner immediately accepts, much to {{mdc|Emolga|gti}}'s chagrin. Virizion proves to be a calm and collected addition to the team, rarely outwardly expressing her emotions, but she changes as more and more is revealed about her past with her last friend, {{mdc|Keldeo|gti}}. She later admits that she likes Emolga.

==Trivia==
* Virizion has the highest {{stat|Special Defense}} base stat of all {{type|Grass}} Pokémon and {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon.
* Virizion is the only member of the [[Swords of Justice]] that:
** is not weak to the types of any of the other members.
** has a type advantage over the members.
** has a double weakness.

===Origin===
Virizion appears to be based on the character of {{wp|Aramis}} from the novel ''{{wp|The Three Musketeers}}''. Like Aramis, it is the best at swordplay. Aramis in the novels was also the most feminine, vain, and romantic, qualities that Virizion possesses relative to its comrades. It physically resembles {{wp|antelope}}s, such as the {{wp|gerenuk}} or other species of {{wp|gazelle}}. It may also be based on a stag (male deer). Like its comrades, its nose resembles that of a sheep.

====Name origin====
Virizion may be derived from ''{{wp|viridian}}'' (a bluish-green color), or simply ''viridis'' (Latin for green), and possibly ''champion''.
