'''Pidgeot''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ピジョット''' ''Pigeot'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Pidgeotto}} starting at [[level]] 36. It is the final form of {{p|Pidgey}}. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Pidgeot''' using the [[Pidgeotite]].

==Biology==
Pidgeot is an avian Pokémon with large wings, sharp talons, and a short, hooked beak. Its glossy {{wp|plumage}} is mostly brown with cream-colored underparts and flight feathers. Its head is decorated crest that is nearly as long as its body. The center feathers of its crest are yellow, while the outer feathers are red. The fan-like feathers of its tail are red or brown. Its beak and legs are pink, and there three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe on each foot. Behind each eye is an angular black marking.

Pidgeot grows noticeably when it Mega Evolves, with a larger body and longer, broader wings. Its wingtips and tailfeathers are tipped with blue, and its cream coloring is now white. Its eyes turn red, and its pupils turn white. Mega Pidgeot has an even more elaborate crest on its head, with a streamer-like red plume extending from a mane of yellow feathers. A red feather projects from the front of its crest and a there is a single red highlight on the left side. The crest is sensitive to air currents, acting like a large antenna and stabilizing Mega Pidgeot's flight. Additionally, its increased wing power allows it to produce gust capable of destroying huge trees.<ref>http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-pidgeot</ref>

Its powerful wings are capable of stirring up windstorms in just a few flaps, and it may spread its wings to intimidate enemies. This Pokémon is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound. Its plumage is often described as beautiful, making it a popular choice for skilled {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. {{m|Gust}} and {{m|Feather Dance}} are its former [[signature move]]s. Pidgeot typically dwells in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}} with thick growth and large trees. It is known to prey on {{p|Magikarp}}, which it can spot from great heights.

==Trivia==
* Pidgeot originally had an extra "t" in its name, but it was dropped.
* Pidgeot is depicted with red and yellow tail feathers in its official [[Generation I]] artwork, while the [[Generation III]] artwork depicts red ones only. This discrepancy is expressed in numerous ways in Pidgeot's in-game sprites and anime depictions.
* When rebattling Gym Leaders in {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, both [[Falkner]] and {{ga|Blue}} have a Pidgeot as their highest-leveled Pokémon.
** Coincidentally, Falkner is the first [[Gym Leader]] while Blue is the last.
* Mega Pidgeot is tied with {{p|Drampa}} and {{p|Porygon-Z}} for the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Despite its name, its appearance and behavior do not resemble a pigeon so much as that of a {{wp|bird of prey}}, specifically {{wp|Aquila (genus)|true eagles}}. In particular, its Shiny coloration resembles a {{wp|Golden Eagle}}. Its eye markings strongly resemble the Sun/Sky gods of Egyptian mythology; {{wp|Ra}} and {{wp|Horus}}.

====Name origin====
Pidgeot and Pigeot are combinations of ''{{wp|Columbidae|pigeon}}'' and ''jet'' (referring to its great speeds).
