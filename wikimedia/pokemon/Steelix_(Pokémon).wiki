'''Steelix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ハガネール''' ''Haganeil'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Onix}} when [[trade]]d holding a [[Metal Coat]]. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Steelix''' using the [[Steelixite]].

==Biology==
Steelix is a long, serpentine Pokémon with a silvery-gray body made up of rock-like sections, which can possess chips and scrapes from fights and tunneling. Three of those sections have long rock spikes coming out of them on either side. It has a massive head mainly made up of its large, wide jaw with sets of large square teeth inside. Along it bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male Steelix, while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.

As Mega Steelix, its body becomes longer, almost doubles its mass, and gains more features. Mega Steelix's eyes turn blue and its lower jaw becomes more heavily armored with a round, curved shape. Additionally, a third pair of ridges appears on its bottom jaw, as well as two sharp, flat structures consisting of three conjoined projections on each side. The gray, rock-like spikes and its tail point have transformed into prism-like crystalline spikes; the segments from which the spikes protrude are much larger as well. In-between the head and individual spiked segments are smaller units, now adorned by a black spot with a blue hexagon on each side. Several metallic-looking scraps constantly rotate around its neck; these scraps react to Mega Steelix's movements and change position when attacking. The cells within its body, crystallized by the energy produced from [[Mega Evolution]], are stronger than any mineral and able to withstand any temperature. It moves incredibly slowly, but its strengthened body is also impervious to damage, and it lashes out at foes without flinching. <ref name="Mega">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-steelix</ref>

Steelix burrows underground and can be found in mountains or {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}}. It lives deep underground, and has been found as deep as six tenths of mile. It is capable of chewing through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Its body is made harder than diamond by the iron it ingests when it eats soil. It's further strengthened by the pressure and heat underground.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Brock's Steelix]]=====
{{an|Brock}}'s {{p|Onix}} evolved into a Steelix sometime before ''[[AG177|Grating Spaces]]'' while it was being trained by Brock's little brother, [[Forrest]], in the [[Pewter City]] Gym. In ''[[SM043|When Regions Collide!]]'', it was revealed that it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Steelix.

=====[[Jasmine's Steelix]]=====
Steelix debuted as one of [[Jasmine]]'s Pokémon in ''[[EP224|Nerves of Steelix!]]''. Jasmine first used Steelix to help {{Ash}} stop {{TRT}} from stealing {{AP|Pikachu}}. Then, during the Gym battle, [[Ash's Cyndaquil]] managed to defeat it, winning Ash the {{badge|Mineral}}.

=====Other=====
{{jo|Harrison}} used a Steelix against Ash during the [[Silver Conference]] in ''[[EP271|Playing with Fire]]''. It defeated {{AP|Noctowl}} but was defeated by his {{AP|Snorlax}}.

==In the manga==
[[File:Jasmine Steelix Adventures.png|thumb|150px|Steelix in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Jasmine's Steelix}}
In [[Pokémon Adventures]], [[Jasmine]] used a Steelix disguised as an {{p|Onix}} in the Gym Leader's Tournament of the opening ceremonies in the Pokémon League. [[Brock's Onix]] tightened its grip on the hidden steel Pokémon, but against the unusual hardiness of its evolution, it only hurt itself, and was eventually defeated after Steelix's stone "hide" scraped off and it was exposed. Jasmine explains that because it was a newly discovered species only so far uncovered by {{adv|Crystal}}'s capture, she tried to hide its identity in the hopes that it wouldn't be treated as simple eye candy for curious spectators.

A Steelix appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to help the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

In ''[[PS278|Put Your Beast Foot Forward]]'', [[Carr]] of the [[Team Rocket]] beast trio used one against {{adv|Red}}'s [[Poli]] as they clashed in the [[Sevii Islands]]. It was swung aside rather easily as it was interrupted in its rampage, and after a failed {{m|Iron Tail}}, it was beaten by a smart {{m|Mind Reader}} maneuver.

Another was on Iron Island and was used for training with [[Riley]] in ''[[PS379|Lucky Lucario I]]''.

A Steelix appeared in ''[[PS415|Double Trouble with Dialga and Palkia V]]''.

===In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure! manga===
[[Byron]] has two Steelix which were used in the challenge in which they served as walls to prevent Hareta from getting to the top in ''[[DPA09|Challenge! The Fortress Of Steel!!]]''.

{{EF|Flint}} mentions having a Steelix in ''[[DPA24|Hareta's Heart's Desire]]'' but it was never shown.

==In the TCG==

==In the TFG==
One Steelix figure has been released.

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Steelix only appears as a random trophy.
====Trophy information====
''A combination of {{t|Steel}}- and {{type|Ground}}s, Steelix are the longest Pokémon yet to be discovered, reaching over 30 feet in length. Since they live so deep under the surface of the earth, the intense pressure has made their bodies stronger than diamonds. Evolved from {{p|Onix}}, Steelix is every bit as intimidating as its relative.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Steelix makes a cameo appearance in the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. When the stage transitions to the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Ironworks Chamber}}, it can be seen in the background along with {{p|Scizor}}, {{p|Klinklang}}, and {{p|Honedge}}.
====Trophy Information====
'''NA:''' ''With a body harder than diamond, this Pokemon is well suited to digging, using its powerful jaws to tunnel around. Steelix lives deep underground - even deeper than its pre-evolution, Onix. Was it pride that made Steelix prove itself able to go farther? It's hard to say. We tried to dig around for clues, but we got tired after only 10 feet...''

'''PAL:''' ''Being harder than diamond, Steelix can crush any rock with its jaw. It can also see in pitch darkness. Its territory lies deeper than its pre-evolution, Onix, a full 1000m below the surface. Does it consider its Onix brethren to be "below" it, even though they're higher up? It's hard to say. We may have to dig a little deeper into the matter.''

===NPC appearances===
====Pokémon Ranger====
Steelix is a boss in Pokémon Ranger. After being enraged by the [[Go-Rock Squad]], it rampages through [[Panula Cave]] until the {{player}} captures it with their Styler.

==Trivia==
* Mega Steelix is tied with {{me|Aggron}} and {{p|Shuckle}} for the highest {{stat|Defense}} stat of all Pokémon.
:* This means Mega Steelix has the highest Defense base stat and the highest single base stat of all {{type|Ground}} Pokémon, and is tied with Mega Aggron for highest Defense base stat and highest single base stat of all {{type|Steel}} Pokémon as well as the highest single base stat of all Mega Evolved Pokémon.
* Steelix is shown floating above the ground in all console games, rather than, like its pre-evolved form, resting on the ground.
* All Steelix in the anime have used the move {{m|Iron Tail}} (excluding cameos).
* Steelix is the only Pokémon in the {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}} games that can hurt the [[Capture Styler]] simply by touching the line.
* Mega Steelix is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Steel}} and the tallest {{Type|Ground}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Steelix, like Onix, is most likely based on a combination of a {{wp|snake}} and {{wp|earthworm}}. It may also been based on the {{wp|European dragon|wyrm}}, a type of dragon that has been presented as limbless and burrowing.

====Name origin====
Steelix is a combination of ''steel'' and ''onyx''. It may also refer to ''helix'' (with regards to its serpentine body).

Haganeil may be a combination of 鋼 ''hagane'' (steel) and ''nail'' or ''tail''.
