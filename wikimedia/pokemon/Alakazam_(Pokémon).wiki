'''Alakazam''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フーディン''' ''Foodin'') is a {{type|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Kadabra}} when [[trade]]d. It is the final form of {{p|Abra}}. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Alakazam''' using the [[Alakazite]].

==Biology==
Alakazam is characterized by its humanoid structure and large mustache. The female Alakazam has a significantly shorter mustache than the male. Its snout is long and thin, and it has long, ear-like spikes extending from the back of its head. Additional spike protrude from each cheek. Covering its yellow, skeletal body are brown armor-like sections over its chest, shoulders, forearms and knees. There are three toes on each foot, each of which has a white claw. It wields a silver spoon in each hand, which act as amplifiers for its psychic abilities. Alakazam is able to lower the accuracy of its opponents by bending the spoons it wields, using its [[signature move]] {{m|Kinesis}}.

As Mega Alakazam, this Pokémon gains a large white beard and its mustache becomes larger and white. The armor-like sections become bulkier, and its upper body section becoming slightly shorter to reveal its thin stomach. The head becomes diamond-shaped, but it keeps its four spikes. Additionally, it gains a large, oval, red organ in the center of its forehead. The organ is said to emit psychic power.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Alakazam</ref> Its lower legs become longer and slimmer and its feet become skinnier and resemble talons. It gains three additional spoons, for a total of five that it levitates in the air. Mega Alakazam's power is entirely converted to pure psychic energy, at the cost of its already-low muscular strength. It can read the course of a person's entire life with a single glance.

Alakazam is able to use all forms of psychic abilities. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck, due to its continually growing brain. It is said to have an excellent memory and can {{wp|Eidetic memory|remember everything that it has experienced}} since hatching as an {{p|Abra}}, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}}.

==Trivia==
* Alakazam could be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Machamp}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary family, they reach their final stage by [[Trade|trading]], and they both have a 75% male gender ratio. Also, Alakazam excels at the {{Stat|Special Attack}} stat, while Machamp excels at {{stat|Attack}}. They are both in all regional Pokédexes (excluding the [[List of Pokémon by Unova Pokédex number|Unova dex]]). Their evolutionary families are also next to each other in the National Pokédex. Moreover, a girl in [[Oreburgh City]] will [[List of in-game trades#Diamond Pearl and Platinum|trade]] her Abra for a Machop.
** Alakazam could also be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Gengar}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary family, which can only be achieved by trading, both have Mega Evolutions, Gengar is weak against Psychic moves and Alakazam is weak against Ghost moves, so they are weak and at the same time strong against each other. They have the same length, and both get smaller when they Mega Evolve. Their base friendship is also the same, with 70. In ''[[EP072|The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis]]'', there are a Gengar and an Alakazam put against each other. Since Generation VI, they both have a Base stat total of 500. Both are weak to Dark-type Pokémon. They also have the same stat structure throughout their evolutions, always having high Speed and Special Attack, and being very low in Physical Defense and still relatively low in Special Defense, HP, and Physical Attack.
* In [[Generation VI]], Alakazam is the only Pokémon whose [[Base stats|base stat total]] does not increase by exactly 100 points upon [[Mega Evolution]], instead gaining only 90 points overall. However, Mega Alakazam received another 10 points in [[Generation VII]], making it the only alternate form Pokémon to receive a boost to its base stats.
* Alakazam has the lowest average [[Performance]] of any fully-evolved Pokémon.
* In {{2v2|Red|Blue}}, an Alakazam sent out by an opponent while the player's Pokémon has low health will have the cry of a {{p|Gastly}}.
* In {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, Alakazam is the same height as {{ga|Ethan}}.

===Origin===
Alakazam is based on a magician and also a {{wp|Spoon bending|spoon bender}}. It also shares similarities to {{wp|goat}}s and {{wp|foxes}}, both animals with ties to magic.

Mega Alakazam is based on a sorcerer or wizard, or possibly [[wp:Sadhu|sadhus]] with psychic powers.

====Name origin====
Alakazam is an incantation used in {{wp|magic (illusion)|stage magic}}, similar to ''{{wp|Abracadabra}}''.

Foodin can be spelled ''Houdin'' and is probably a reference to {{wp|Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin}} or {{wp|Harry Houdini}}, who were both famous magicians, as the Japanese names of the Abra line are based on famous mystics.
