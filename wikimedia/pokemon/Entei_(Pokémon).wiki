'''Entei''' (Japanese: '''エンテイ''' ''Entei'') is a {{type|Fire}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Suicune}}, it is one of the [[Legendary beasts]] said to be resurrected by {{p|Ho-Oh}} after the burning of the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]. Out of the three beasts, Entei is said to represent the flames that burned the Brass Tower.

==Biology==
Entei is a massive, {{wp|lion|leonine}} quadruped with some {{wp|mastiff}} qualities. It is covered in brown fur and a long, light gray cloud of smoke for a mane running along its entire back. It has gray plates on either side of the mane and a plate beneath the cream belly fur on its chest. Entei has gray paws with brown pads and black cuff-like bands on its legs. Its main faceplate is red and shaped like fins or a six-sided star. A gray plate, resembling a horseshoe mustache, covers its muzzle. It also has a yellow crest with three sloped points on its forehead and red eyes. As a whole, Entei's head appears to resemble a {{wp|kabuto}}.

An Entei is born whenever a new volcano appears. It is also said that whenever Entei roars, a volcano erupts somewhere in the world. Entei races across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} at high speeds.

Entei appeared as a beam of light in ''[[PS117|Slugging It Out With Slugma]]''. Its first real appearance was in ''[[PS137|Really Raikou & Entirely Entei I]]'', where it along with Raikou tests Falkner and were joined by Suicune in ''[[PS138|Really Raikou & Entirely Entei II]]'', discussing about Ho-oh. It was revealed in a flashback in ''[[PS141|Hello, Lickitung]]'', where it was awakened by {{adv|Yellow}} along with its two counterparts, and the three raced around [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]] looking for {{pkmn|Trainer}}s to help them defeat the [[Masked Man]] to free {{p|Ho-Oh}}. After it saves Silver and {{adv|Gold}}'s lives in ''[[PS142|Really Remoraid]]'', after their defeat against the Masked Man in the [[Lake of Rage]], it brought them to one of the [[Whirl Islands]] to heal them with its flames and later left prior to Silver awakening. [[Blaine]] uses this fire to burn away the {{p|Mewtwo}} cells infecting his arm and eventually pairs up with him, and later {{adv|Silver}}. Later [[DJ Mary]]'s {{p|Smeargle}} copies this power using {{m|Sketch}}. Once the Masked Man is defeated, Entei once again joins its comrades and roams the land of Johto once again.

''"A Volcano Pokémon. When Entei barks, a volcano erupts, and it's said that a new Entei is born every time a volcano appears.

'''PAL:''' ''One of the three Legendary Pokémon to rise from the ashes of the Burned Tower. It has a distinctive white mane running along its back. Its powerful Fire Spin attack will suck in any fighters nearby and trap them, dealing damage all the while. When the fire burns itself out, any fighters within are blasted off the stage.''

* Entei shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Quilava}} and {{p|Typhlosion}}. They are all known as the Volcano Pokémon.
** Coincidentally, they all learn {{m|Eruption}}.
* Entei's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are the same: 244.
* Entei has the highest base {{stat|HP}} of all {{type|Fire}} Pokémon.
* In {{3v2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}}, playing Entei's cry in the Pokédex then switching to {{p|Suicune}} or {{p|Raikou}} before the cry ends {{DL|List of glitches in Generation II|Legendary beast cry distortion|causes a distortion in the cries of Suicune or Raikou}}.
* An [[Pokémon Gold and Silver beta#Events|unused event]] present in the data of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}} (but removed from {{v2|Crystal}}) allows for the player to obtain a level 40 Entei.
* Entei's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 1 HP and 2 Attack is unique.

===Origin===
Entei may be based on {{wp|Chinese guardian lions}}, or Lions of Foo, creatures that resemble fully grown male lions. They are often confused with canines and incorrectly called "Foo Dogs" by Westerners. Their original significance was serving as guardians (like gargoyles upon churches) at Buddhist temples. The image of a ferocious beast would scare intruders away. This correlates with Entei being seen as a guardian in the third movie, protecting Molly and her allies.

Like a real lion, Entei boasts a regal mane, long retractable claws, and a strong, bulky, yet agile body. Its face is short and bears resemblance to a lion's skull — short and wedged, but with the unique flatness that ShiShi statues also bore. The yellow design on its head could be interpreted as a stylized crown or a Kabuto helmet. In China, the lion is regarded as a symbol of power and strength. Lions are also popularly known as symbols of fire. However, Entei also resembles large short-muzzled {{wp|dog}}s, such as a {{wp|mastiff}}. Entei's brown shaggy fur and white paws and muzzle are similar to a {{wp|St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard}}, a large dog known for its strength. Its lion-like appearance, mask-like face, and masses of fur make it look like the Balinese lion spirit {{wp|Barong (mythology)|Barong}}, a guardian spirit who kills the wicked witch {{wp|Rangda}} in order to maintain the balance of good and evil.

Entei's roar is known throughout the Pokémon world as a sign of a new volcano erupting, and a new Entei being born. Entei may also have some inspiration from the {{wp|Aterui}}, the chief of the Emishi, who was later labeled as a demon called 'Aka-gashira' (Red-Head). It also has the appearance of a {{wp|volcano}}, its head is volcano-shaped and has a bright yellow eruption-flame on the top, and the red {{wp|magma}} is seen on the side of its face, it has volcanic smoke leaving from the back and has two spiky mountains on the back.

====Name origin====
Entei may be a combination of 炎天 ''enten'' (blazing heat) or 炎 ''en'' (flame, an alternate reading of ''honō'') and 皇帝 ''kōtei'' (emperor). It can be written in kanji as 炎帝 (identical to the Chinese {{wp|Yan Emperor|Yándì}}).
