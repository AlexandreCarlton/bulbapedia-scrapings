'''Absol''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アブソル''' ''Absol'') is a {{type|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Absol''' using the [[Absolite]].

==Biology==
Absol is a quadruped, mammalian Pokémon with a dark blue to black body covered in white fur. It has a ruff around its neck and chest and a tuft on the top of its head adorned with a single blue-black oval. It has a feline face with almond-shaped, red eyes, a scythe-like tail, and a crescent shaped horn on the side of its head. Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs.

As Mega Absol, its fur is longer overall, and the increased energy coursing through its body makes the fur at the back of its mane stand on end, so that it appears to have wings.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/</ref> The spikes on its heels and elbows grow larger, and the fur in these areas becomes longer as well. Its sickle-shaped horn widens, while an additional, smaller horn appears on the opposite side of its head. Its tail now has a more saw-like shape, and the oval marking on its forehead is now a rounded triangle.

Absol lives in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}} far from civilization, and rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a disaster will occur, and will try to warn people when one is approaching. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster, notably by the elderly. Mega Absol emits a fearsome aura that has been known to kill fainthearted people from shock. It directs this aura at its opponents by beating its "wings", which are not capable of flight. However, Absol apparently detests assuming this form, as it normally dislikes fighting in the first place.

==In the anime==

===Major appearances===
Absol debuted in ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]''. The Disaster Pokémon showed up to take {{OBP|Jirachi|M06}} back to [[Forina]]. However, Absol wasn't evil, and helped Jirachi once it returned to Forina.

Absol made its main series debut in ''[[AG107|Absol-ute Disaster]]''. The people of a town were blaming Absol for all of the bad things that were happening to their town during the past month. {{Ash}} and friends (along with a boy named {{OBP|Nicky|AG107}}) went out to verify the accusations. They found out that the Absol was actually warning the town about a flood.

An Absol appeared in ''[[AG167|What I Did for Love!]]'', under the ownership of a {{pkmn|Coordinator}} named [[Mollie]]. It was used in the second round of the [[Gardenia Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]], where it battled [[Brock's Marshtomp]] and lost.

[[Drew]] caught and trained an Absol for the [[Kanto Grand Festival]], as seen in ''[[AG180|May, We Harley Drew'd Ya!]]''. It was first used in the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]]. It appeared again in ''[[AG182|Thinning the Hoard!]]'' and ''[[AG182|Channeling the Battle Zone!]]'', where it and {{p|Flygon}} were used during a [[Double Battle|two-on-two]] [[Contest Battle]] against {{an|May}}, who used {{TP|May|Combusken}} and {{TP|May|Squirtle}}. In the end, Drew lost too many points, resulting in May advancing to the next round.

An Absol that can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Absol debuted in ''[[SS029|Mega Evolution Special I]]'', under the ownership of [[Astrid]]. It was shown having a battle against [[Alain]] and {{TP|Alain|Charizard}}, but it was defeated. Astrid's Absol reappeared in ''[[M17|Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction]]'', where it was used in a battle against {{Ash}} and his {{AP|Hawlucha}}, which resulted in Absol winning. It later had a rematch with {{p|Hawlucha}} in ''[[XY126|Valuable Experience for All!]]'' during the [[Lumiose Conference]], which resulted in a loss for Absol.

An Absol appeared in ''[[XY028|The Bonds of Evolution!]]'', under the ownership of {{OBP|Magnus|XY028}}. Magnus used Absol to battle in his battle against [[Diantha]] and her {{TP|Diantha|Gardevoir}}, but it was soon defeated by Gardevoir's {{m|Moonblast}}.

An Absol appeared in [[SM053]] and [[SM054]], under the ownership of [[Lusamine]].

===Minor appearances===
An Absol appeared in ''[[DP020|Mutiny in the Bounty]]'', captured by the evil {{pkmn|Hunter}} [[J]] and [[J's henchmen|her henchmen]] after [[Ash's Pikachu]], [[Melodi]]'s {{p|Gardevoir}}, and {{TRT}}'s {{MTR}} got stolen. The Absol was returned to its rightful owner after Ash, Team Rocket, and Melodi reunited with their Pokémon and some of J's minions were arrested.

An Absol made a brief cameo appearance in both ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'' and ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''.

Four Absol appeared in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', under the ownership of [[Damos]].

A Mega Absol appeared in the ending credits of ''[[M17|Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction]]''.

Absol is also present in the feud between {{p|Kyogre}} and {{p|Groudon}}. Like in the anime, Absol is accused of bringing disaster. This Absol appears again at the start of the {{chap|Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire}} where it appeared on top of a building foreshadowing another disaster coming to Hoenn.

In ''[[PAXY28|Scizor Defends]]'', {{adv|Y}} encountered an Absol on Route 15 and battled him in order to capture a Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution. He made no attempt to resist her efforts and let himself be captured after Y asked him to help battle Team Flare, which he was nicknamed Solsol.

===In the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Ginji's Rescue Team manga===
Absol appeared in ''[[GRT4|Battle in a Bitter Cold Land!!]]''. When it first saw [[Ginji]]'s scar, it was scared of him because [[Team Meanies|Gengar]] told it that Ginji will destroy the world, but after Ginji explained that he is going to see {{p|Ninetales}} to find out the truth, Absol tells him that everyone thinks that it's causing the natural disasters and that they don't like it because of that misunderstanding. It then helps Ginji and {{OBP|Mudkip|Ginji's Rescue Team}} in their battle against {{p|Articuno}}. It appears again in ''[[GRT6|Tears and Emotions - It's the Final Chapter!]]'' where it, along with several other Pokémon, help Ginji, Mudkip, [[Team A.C.T.|Tyranitar, Charizard, and Alakazam]] defeat {{p|Groudon}}.

==Trivia==
* Absol's location in many games support its description of appearing where disasters occur:
** In {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}}, Absol appears on {{rt|213|Sinnoh}}, which is close to [[Lake Valor]], which was drained by Team Galactic.
** In {{v2|Platinum}}, Absol appears on [[Mt. Coronet]] in places that one can first access when heading to the [[Spear Pillar]], before Giratina is released by Team Galactic.
** In {{2v2|Black|White}}, Absol can be found at the [[Giant Chasm]], a place where disasters are said to befall Trainers, and {{rt|13|Unova}}, 13 being known as an unlucky number. Indeed, {{game3|Black and White|two years later|s 2}}, the Giant Chasm is where Team Plasma makes its stand.
** In {{2v2|Sun|Moon}}, Absol can be found in [[Tapu Village]], which was destroyed years earlier by {{p|Tapu Bulu}}.
** In [[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]], Absol can be found in the [[Altru Building]] and [[Altru Tower]], from which [[Team Dim Sun]] plans to take control of all Pokémon in the region.
* Mega Absol is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 565.
* Absol was the last answer to the [[Pokémon Trainer's Choice]].
* Absol is the only non-[[legendary Pokémon]] featured on the box art for {{g|Box Ruby & Sapphire}}.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Absol}}
Absol is most likely based on the {{wp|Bai Ze}} (白澤) of Chinese mythology, whose name literally translates to "white marsh." It is generally described as a white beast, distinguished by having one or two horns on its head. Considered to be an intelligent beast, Bai Ze is gifted with the ability to understand human speech and the knowledge on the forms and habits of 11,520 types of supernatural creatures in the world. In legend, Bai Ze shared its knowledge to the Yellow Emperor, which was subsequently compiled in a book called ''Bai Ze Tu''. Few of its supposed fragments survive today. In Japan, it is known as the ''hakutaku'' (白沢). In a related legend, a similar creature known as the ''kutabe'' predicted that a plague would sweep through the Toyama Prefecture of Japan. It is also sometimes said to have an extra eye on their head or back, which may be represented by the oval that appears on Absol's forehead. Absol's head is modeled after a {{wp|Taijitu}} symbol. Absol's humanized face and feline appearance may also be a homage to the {{wp|sphinx}}. Its scythe-shaped tail and horn suggest a resemblance to the Western personified depiction of {{wp|Death (personification)|Death}}, who is related to destiny and disaster. It may have also been inspired by the {{wp|black cat}} superstition. Due to its feline appearance and it living in mountains Absol may also draw inspiration from a {{wp|cougar}}.

Mega Absol's wings and elongated hair give it the appearance of an {{wp|angel}}, with its wings also being reminiscent of Greek portrayals of sphinxes and furthering the connection to sphinxes noted above.

====Name origin====
Absol may derive from 物騒 ''bussō'' (dangerous). It may also be a combination of ''ab-'' ("away from") and ''sol'' (Latin for ''sun''), referring to its {{type|Dark}} nature. The latter may also be a reference to a solar eclipse, as many cultures considered a solar eclipse as a sign of end-times or disaster.

It may also be derived from ''absolute'', relating to its ability to foretell impending disasters. Or from ''absolve'', meaning "to free someone from punishment or blame," or, "to be declared as innocent for an accused wrongdoing," in reference to it being misunderstood and undeserving of its reputation as doom-bringer.

Alternatively it could derive from ''Absalom'', a name which is said to bring bad luck, according to Jewish tradition.
