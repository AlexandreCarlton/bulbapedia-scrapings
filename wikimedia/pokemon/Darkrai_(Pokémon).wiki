'''Darkrai''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ダークライ''' ''Darkrai'') is a {{type|Dark}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It was officially revealed in February 2007.

It is a member of the [[Lunar duo]] with {{p|Cresselia}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Darkrai legs.png|thumb|left|250px|Darkrai's legs]]
Darkrai is a black, shadow-like Pokémon. It has a small head with a white fog-like ghostly plume billowing from its head covering one of its bright blue eyes, with the portion on its face resembling hair. It also has a red spiky growth around its neck. It has skinny arms and long black tatters hanging from its shoulders. It also has black, claw-like hands. It has the slight appearance of an hourglass figure and appears to be wearing an old, ripped cloak. It normally does not have any sort of legs, but it is able to extend stilt-like appendages in their place. In self-defense, Darkrai can retract its head and white "plume" into the pit atop its torso fringed by the aforementioned red growth.

Darkrai is known to "inhabit" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a [[Lunar Wing]] from {{p|Cresselia}}. However, the "unleashing of nightmares" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. It can become a shadow and escape danger or contact of humans. It is also capable of little human speech. In ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', it was shown its power was little of that of {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}. As seen in [[DP104|an anime episode]], Darkrai does not only cause nightmares; it is also attracted to them. It can also go around objects it is attracted to several times, as seen in the mentioned episode and [[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]]. Darkrai possibly feeds off dreams, characterized by its association with never-ending nightmares. Darkrai is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] that learns {{m|Dark Void}}.

==In the anime==
[[File:Tobias Darkrai.png|thumb|250px|Darkrai in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Darkrai (M10)]]====
{{OBP|Darkrai|M10}} debuted in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'' as a protagonist. It took the task of holding off the fighting between {{mov|Dialga}} and {{mov|Palkia}} until {{Ash}} and {{an|Dawn}} could put the [[Oración]] disk in the [[Space-Time Tower]] music player to calm the two [[Legendary Pokémon]] down. It reappeared in a cameo in the end credits of ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]''.

====Other====
Darkrai made its main series debut in ''[[DP104|Sleepless In Pre-Battle!]]''. Unlike the Darkrai in the film, this Darkrai was ''causing'' nightmares, much like in the {{pkmn|games}}. According to [[Officer Jenny]], it comes at a certain time every year. In the episode, however, it came earlier due to it being lured by {{TRT}}'s machine, which was also causing nightmares. Cresselia is normally in the same place as Darkrai to stop it from giving nightmares, but due to Darkrai's early arrival, the people in [[Canalave City]] had nightmares for several days. One night, it was concealing itself when {{p|Cresselia}} used its abilities to reveal it from the darkness. The two then battled and Darkrai hid itself once more in the shadows.

In ''[[DP183|League Unleashed!]]'', a mysterious {{pkmn|Trainer}} in the [[Lily of the Valley Conference]] was shown to have a Darkrai. In [[DP184|the following episode]], [[Conway]] revealed that the Trainer, {{si|Tobias}}, had easily defeated eight [[Gym Leader]]s of the [[Sinnoh]] [[region]] using only Darkrai. In the Sinnoh League semifinals, this Darkrai was used in the match against Ash, where it easily defeated {{AP|Heracross}}, {{AP|Torkoal}}, and {{AP|Gible}}. However, it was defeated by [[Ash's Sceptile]] in ''[[DP189|The Semi-Final Frontier!]]''.

A Darkrai appeared in ''[[PK26|Pikachu, What's This Key?]]''.

A Darkrai appeared in ''[[XY098|Dream a Little Dream from Me!]]''. It was the source of {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{MTR}}, and [[Squishy]]'s nightmare.

===Minor appearances===
A Darkrai appeared in ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]''.

===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Darkrai (M10)}}
Darkrai plays a major role in the first {{series|Diamond & Pearl}} {{pkmn|movie}}, ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]''. Likewise, it appears in the {{ma|The Rise of Darkrai|manga adaptation}} of the film by [[Ryo Takamisaki]].

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
In ''[[PS302|Phew for Mew]]'', [[Sird]] let out a beam of light from a [[Poké Ball]] upon seeing {{adv|Deoxys}} leaving for space. Thinking that Sird was trying to retrieve Deoxys, {{adv|Red}}, {{adv|Blue}}, {{adv|Green}}, {{adv|Yellow}}, and {{adv|Silver}} tried to stop her, and {{adv|Mewtwo}} charged into the light of the Poké Ball. Within moments, the five [[Pokédex Holder]]s were turned into stone, and a black shadow appeared in front of Sird. When Sird reappeared in front of her [[Team Galactic]] colleagues in ''[[PS414|Double Trouble with Dialga and Palkia IV]]'' and explained what happened, the black shadow was revealed to be Darkrai, though Sird still did not reveal its name. Darkrai later reappeared in ''[[PS438|The Final Dimensional Duel VIII]]'', where it was revealed that Sird had released it into the Distortion World. It first faced its arch-rival {{p|Cresselia}}. [[Charon]] later took control of the Pokémon, and, along with Giratina and Heatran, used it in a battle against the Sinnoh Legendary Pokémon in the climax of the chapter. Darkrai was later freed from the control of Charon, and departed to parts unknown.

Darkrai appeared as a silhouette in ''[[PS430|Unplugging Rotom (Heat, Wash, Mow, Fan, Frost)]]''.

===In the Pocket Monsters DP manga===
A Darkrai appeared in ''[[PMDP19|The Illusory Pokémon Darkrai Appears!!]]''.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Dark-type Pokémon can cause people and other Pokémon to experience nightmares. While it is floating in the air, it tucks its legs in so far, it looks like they vanish! In battle it will use a move called Dark Void, which sucks in surrounding opponents and puts them into a deep sleep. ''

'''PAl''': ''A Pokémon shrouded in mystery, Darkrai has the ability to implant nightmares into the minds of both humans and Pokémon. It has legs, but seems to prefer to float in the air. Its favourite move in this game is Dark Void. When this attack hits something, it creates a vortex that sucks in fighters and puts them to sleep. ''

Darkrai is a playable character in the arcade and Nintendo Switch versions of Pokkén Tournament.

==Trivia==
* Darkrai's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 2 Special Attack and 1 Speed is unique.
* Darkrai has two different portrait pictures in both {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}, and {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}.
* Sailor [[Eldritch]]'s son says ''"<sc>Dar... Dark...</sc> Is watching me..."'' in his sleep before the player cures his nightmare. It is assumed that he is talking about Darkrai, as it is known to give its victims horrific nightmares.
** If Darkrai ''was'' the cause of the sailor's son's nightmares, it can be assumed Darkrai is aware that the player cured the boy using {{p|Cresselia}}'s [[Lunar Wing]]. When the player takes the [[Member Card]] to the Harbor Inn, the innkeeper (presumably an illusion created by Darkrai) states that he has been waiting for the player's arrival.
* In the early Japanese versions of {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}}, Darkrai can be caught with the [[Surf glitch]]. However, this glitch was fixed in other language versions. [[Tweaking|Another glitch]] has been discovered that allows players of other language releases to reach Darkrai without the Member Card.
** This has been remedied in {{game|Platinum}}, however, as Darkrai itself will not appear on the island without the event ticket.

===Origin===
Darkrai's appearance and abilities suggest it is based on the concept of {{wp|nightmares}}. Resembling a {{wp|shadow}}, it may also have been inspired by the {{wp|bogeyman}}, the Greek god {{wp|Morpheus}}, {{wp|genie}}s (or {{wp|jinn}}), or the {{wp|Oneiroi}}, namely {{wp|Phobetor}}.

====Name origin====
Darkrai is a combination of ''dark'', and 暗い ''kurai'' (dark) or "rai" (Hindi for king).
