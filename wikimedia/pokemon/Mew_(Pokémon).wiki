'''Mew''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミュウ''' ''Mew'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Mew is notable for its unique ability to learn every [[TM|Technical Machine]], [[HM|Hidden Machine]], and [[Move Tutor]] move (except those exclusive to a particular Pokémon or group of Pokémon, such as {{m|Draco Meteor}} and {{m|Secret Sword}}).

Mew is the last Pokémon in the [[List of Pokémon by Kanto Pokédex number|Kanto Pokédex]].

It is a member of the [[Mew duo]] along with {{p|Mewtwo}}.

==Biology==
Mew is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features. Its snout is short and wide, and it has triangular ears and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws, large hind legs and feet with oval markings on the soles, and a long, thin tail ending in an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope. Mew is said to have the {{wp|DNA}} of every single Pokémon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack.

As demonstrated by its behavior in the [[M01|first]] and [[M08|eighth]] Pokémon movies, it shows signs of intelligence, curiosity, playfulness, and even selflessness. Mew is incredibly adaptable, able to travel freely in the air or underwater. As seen in [[Pokémon Snap]], it can create a green/yellow/pink orb of energy around itself for protection.

[[Pokémon Mansion journals|Reports]] found in [[Cinnabar Island]]'s {{ka|Pokémon Mansion}} note scientific expeditions that have sighted Mew in [[Guyana]], South America, the place where it was first discovered. Since Mew can make itself invisible at will, very few people have {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|knowingly seen it}}, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be a mirage. It will only show itself to a person who is pure of heart.

Mew  is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the exclusive [[Z-Move]] {{m|Genesis Supernova}}.

==In the anime==
{{spoilers}}
===In the main series===
[[File:Mew M01.png|thumb|250px|left|Mew in ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'']]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Mew (M01)]]=====
Mew debuted in ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]''. A {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01}} was cloned from Mew's DNA, extracted from Mew's eyelash. Later, Mew started appearing around [[New Island]] while Mewtwo was testing his [[starter Pokémon]] clones. Mew followed [[Team Rocket]] into the main part of the island so it could stop Mewtwo from destroying the world. After the end credits, Mew is shown flying to the mountains.

In the Japanese version, Mew's characterization was different. Mew's intention was to wipe out cloned Pokémon, Mewtwo included, because it viewed them as inferior, in contrast to Mewtwo, who wished to eliminate natural-born.

Mew also appeared in the radio drama ''[[The Birth of Mewtwo]]'', which was adapted into the anime short ''[[The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin]]''.

Mew made a small appearance in the hour-length special ''[[Mewtwo Returns]]'', the sequel to ''Mewtwo Strikes Back''. Mew is first shown in flashbacks of the first movie and then named by Mewtwo when it reflects about its creation before the title screen appears (though this dialogue was changed in the dub and Mew is not named). Mewtwo also sees Mew after being thrown into the Purity Spring, but this Mew is just part of Mewtwo's imagination.
[[File:Mew M08.png|thumb|250px|Mew in ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]'']]
=====[[Mew (M08)]]=====
Another Mew first appeared transformed as a {{p|Ho-Oh}}, and then as a {{p|Taillow}}, landing on [[Cameran Palace]] and then {{m|transform}}ing into {{p|Treecko}}. It then transformed into an {{p|Aipom}} to play with [[Ash's Pikachu]]. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} released their Pokémon to play with what they thought was an Aipom.

Mew led the team's Pokémon to an attic full of toys, and while playing with them, it transformed into a {{p|Pikachu}}, then back into its original form. [[Kidd Summers]], who had been spying, sent her two {{p|Weavile}} after it. To escape, it {{m|teleport}}ed itself, along with Pikachu and {{MTR}}. It then transformed once again into a {{p|Pidgeot}} and flew the Pokémon to the [[Tree of Beginning]]. While Ash and the others were looking for Pikachu, Mew kept it entertained with toys.

Mew also nearly sacrificed itself to save the Tree of Beginning. {{OBP|Lucario|M08}} stepped in and was able to save Mew, but ended up sacrificing itself. Mew is believed to still reside at the Tree of Beginning. It is last seen playing with a {{p|Bonsly}}.

=====Other=====
A Mew appeared in [[PK14]].

A Mirage Mew appeared in ''[[The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon]]'', where it helped interfere with the plans of [[Dr. Yung|Mirage Master]].

====Minor appearances====
[[File:Mew anime.png|thumb|250px|left|Mew in the main anime]]
A Mew appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

A Mew made a brief cameo in the opening sequence of ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', where it was seen being attacked by {{OBP|Mewtwo|original series|Mewtwo}}.

Mew made its main series debut in the [[boss fantasy]] of ''[[DP092|A Lean Mean Team Rocket Machine!]]''. As of this episode, every {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}} has appeared in at least one episode of the anime.

An image of Mew appeared on a computer screen used by [[Mewtwo's creators]] in ''[[M16|Genesect and the Legend Awakened]]''.

A Mew made a cameo appearance in the ending credits in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

A Mew made its physical main series debut in ''[[SM042|Alola, Kanto!]]'', where it was seen flying around near [[Professor Oak's Laboratory]]. This is the latest main series physical debut of any of the original 151 Pokémon.

[[File:Mew PO.png|thumb|250px|Mew in [[Pokémon Origins]]]]

===In Pokémon Origins===
A Mew briefly appeared at the end of ''[[PO04|File 4: Charizard]]'', being the only {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}} that {{OBP|Red|Origins}} had not caught by the end of the mini-series.
{{-}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Mew Adventures.png|thumb|220px|Mew in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the movie adaptations===
{{main|Mew (M01)}}
{{main|Mew (M08)}}
Two different Mew appear in the {{ma|Mewtwo Strikes Back!|manga}} {{ma|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew|adaptations}} of the [[M01|first]] and [[M08|eighth]] [[Pokémon movie]]s.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Mew (Adventures)}}
Mew debuted in the first round of the {{chap|Red, Green & Blue}}, ''[[PS001|A Glimpse of the Glow]]''.

In ''[[PS017|The Jynx Jinx]]'', {{adv|Green}}'s [[Ditty]] {{m|transform}}ed into Mew as an example to Red. It later used this form to lure the Team Rocket Grunts away.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
A Mew appeared in ''[[PM004|Obtain the Moon Stone!!]]''. This one is actually a woman who was accidentally transformed after an experiment went wrong. She turns back later to her normal form.

{{OBP|Giovanni|Pocket Monsters}} catches Mew as part of the supplies used for the creation of {{p|Mewtwo}}. It was released along with Mewtwo after the creation was unsuccessful.

===In the Pokémon Ruby-Sapphire manga===
{{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} befriended a Mew in ''[[PMRS50|Showdown! Clefairy VS Mew!!]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Mew (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:SSBB Mew.png|right|thumb|200px|Mew in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===Super Smash Bros. series===
In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' Mew will sometimes appear out of a [[Poké Ball]]. When summoned, it will use {{m|Fly}} to leave the arena. In single player, the summoner is awarded the "Mew Catcher" bonus, worth 10,000 points.

After unlocking every character in [[Super Smash Bros. Melee|Melee]], there is a 1 in 251 chance of Mew appearing from a Poké Ball. The thrower of the Poké Ball receives the same "Mew Catcher" bonus.

Mew returns again as a rare Pokémon in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]], the chance of it appearing is 1 in 493 this time. Like the other "secret" Pokémon, it drops rare items instead of just flying away. In Mew's case, the items are CDs. However, once all the pick-up CDs are obtained, it will drop Stickers instead.

Mew returns in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]'' and comes out of a Poké Ball (rarely) and/or Master Ball (rare, but less rare than a Poké Ball).

Mew throughout the ''Smash'' series, much like Mewtwo, is roughly akin to the first movie portrayal, especially having Kōichi Yamadera reprise his role.
====Melee trophy information====
''Mew is an extremely rare Pokémon that has been seen by only a few people. Information on every Pokémon in the world is contained in Mew's cell structure, so it has the ability to use any and all TMs and HMs. Some Pokémon scholars believe Mew to be the ancestor of all existing Pokémon, but the idea is debatable.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A New Species Pokémon. An extremely rare Pokémon that contains the DNA of all other Pokémon, it is thought by many scholars to be a Pokémon ancestor, considering the wide range of moves it can use. On top of being able to make itself invisible, Mew can also {{m|transform}} into any opponent Pokémon and use characteristics and moves in exactly the same way."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Mew is a Pokémon previously thought to be extinct but rediscovered by [[Mr. Fuji|Dr. Fuji]]. This Legendary Pokémon doesn't often show itself to humans, so it is considered quite lucky to see one. In Smash Bros., Mew will appear and then use Fly to sail away, leaving behind a gift. Thanks, Mew! ''

'''PAL''': ''Mew was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered by Dr. Fuji in Guyana. This Mythical Pokémon doesn't often show itself to humans, so it's considered very lucky to see one. In this game, it will float upwards and leave a present behind. If only Mew would turn up more often, eh?''

==={{g|Snap}}===
Mew appears in the seventh course, [[Rainbow Cloud]]. Although the game is not combat-oriented, the difficulty of photographing Mew effectively makes it the game's boss. Mew floats in a bubble that turns opaque when the zoom is activated, so players must throw a series of Pester Balls or Food at it to break the bubble so Mew will come out for a clear shot. Photographing Mew gets an automatic bonus of 2500 points, making it the highest ranking Pokémon in the game with a highest possible score of 10,000 points with perfect positioning, size and pose.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Mew is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Grass Cornet]].
* In [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]] Mew takes Pikachu and their friends {{p|Chikorita}}, {{p|Piplup}}, and {{p|Charmander}} to the {{ga|PokéPark}}. He then appears to Pikachu in a dream once they've arrived in the PokéPark and tells Pikachu to collect pieces of the [[Sky Prism]] so that peace can be restored to the PokéPark. Once all the pieces have been obtained Mew awaits Pikachu at the [[Sky Pavilion]] where he plays. In this game, Mew is referred to as male, despite being genderless in the main series.

==Trivia==
* Despite being a clone of Mew, {{p|Mewtwo}} appears before Mew in the Pokédex.
* Mew was the only Pokémon of the first 151 to be left out of the original version of the [[Kanto Pokérap|Pokérap]].
* In Generation I and II, due to technical limitations, ''New Species'' is labeled in game as ''NEW SPECIE'' (and in early versions, labeled as ''NEWSPECIES'').
* Mew was a little-known secret when {{game|Red and Green|s}} were first released in Japan. Even Nintendo was not initially aware that [[Shigeki Morimoto]] had programmed it into the game.<ref>http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_pokmon_heartgold_version__soulsilver_version_16288_16289.html</ref>
** In an interview with [[Game Freak]] and [[Creatures, Inc.]] in [[Nintendo Power]] issue 134, [[Shigeki Morimoto]] revealed that he created Mew two weeks before game development was finished.
* In the games, lost scientific reports state that Mew was found in the forests of [[Guyana]].
* In [[Generation III]], Mew is the only Generation I Pokémon that cannot be encountered in {{2v2|FireRed|LeafGreen}}, as well as the only Generation I Legendary or Mythical Pokémon that can be encountered in {{v2|Emerald}}.
* Mew is tied with Mewtwo for the most anime opening appearances of any Legendary or Mythical Pokémon, with seven in Japan.
* Mew is the only genderless Pokémon able to learn {{m|Captivate}}; however, when used by genderless Pokémon, this move will always fail.
* In [[Super Smash Bros.]] it has a chance of 1 out of 151 to appear, in [[Super Smash Bros. Melee]], its chance to appear is 1 out of 251, and in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]], its chance to appear is 1 out of 493. This is a reference to how many Pokémon were out during the release of each game (151 in [[Generation I]], 251 in [[Generation II]], and 493 in [[Generation IV]]).
[[File:Wildmew.png|thumb|right|A wild Mew found using the [[Mew glitch]]]]
* Mew shares the move {{m|Transform}} with {{p|Ditto}}, along with also sharing the same {{Shiny}} coloration and the same weight. In addition, in {{game|Yellow}}, Ditto can be encountered in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island, where [[Pokémon Mansion journals|diary entries]] on Mew can be found.
* The US release of Mew as an event for {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}} happened on the ten-year anniversary of the original release of {{2v2|Gold|Silver}}.
* Mew was voted the most popular Pokémon in the {{n|Official Pokémon website announces Pokémon Power Bracket|Pokémon Power Bracket}}, which included all Legendary and Mythical Pokémon from the first four generations.
* Mew started the trend of every generation (through [[Generation V]]) introducing a Mythical Pokémon with a base stat total of 600 and a stat distribution of 100 all around. Others that follow this trend include {{p|Celebi}}, {{p|Jirachi}}, {{p|Manaphy}}, {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Land Forme}} {{p|Shaymin}}, and {{p|Victini}}.
* The only way to legitimately obtain a {{Shiny}} Mew is via the [[Old Sea Map]] on a Japanese copy of {{game|Emerald}}.
* Mew is one of two Pokémon to have the shortest English Pokémon name, {{p|Muk}} being the other.

===Trademark===
* Mew (then spelled ミュー, not ミュウ) was the first Pokémon trademark ever registered (granted on March 31, 1994, registration number 2636685 part 12), before even Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター), which was granted on December 26, 1997.
** ミュウ was registered on August 6, 1999, registration number 4302090.
* Mew is also the first Pokémon trademark ever applied for; the application was submitted on May 9, 1990, application number 平2-51989; before even Pocket Monsters, which was submitted September 11, 1995.
** ミュウ was submitted on June 17, 1997, application number 平9-128909.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Mew}}
Mew is similar to a vertebrate {{wp|embryo}}. It shares many traits with {{wp|cats}}. Its morphology is also vaguely similar to a {{wp|jerboa}}, having large hind legs and a long skinny tail. It is believed by scientists to be the ancestor of all other Pokémon, which, along with its resemblance to an embryo, may be a reference to the {{wp|recapitulation theory}}.

====Name origin====
Mew may be derived from 妙 ''myō'' (strange/unusual), ''mew'' (the sound a kitten makes, referring to its size and cat-like appearance), or ''{{wp|mutant}}'' (myūtanto), or it may be a combination of ''mystery'' and ''new'' (considering that it is mysterious and "newly" discovered).
