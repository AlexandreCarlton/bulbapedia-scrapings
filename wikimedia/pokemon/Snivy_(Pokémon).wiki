'''Snivy''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ツタージャ''' ''Tsutarja'') is a {{type|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Servine}} starting at level 17, which evolves into {{p|Serperior}} starting at level 36.

Along with {{p|Tepig}} and {{p|Oshawott}}, Snivy is one of three [[starter Pokémon]] of [[Unova]] available at the beginning of {{game|Black and White|s|Pokémon Black, White}}, [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2|Black 2, and White 2]].

==Biology==
Snivy is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a slender build. Most of its body is green with a cream underside. A yellow stripe runs down the length of its back and tail, and it has yellow markings around its large eyes. Two curved yellow structures that resemble leaves or small wings protrude from its shoulders and bend backwards. Its slender arms have three fingers, while its tiny feet have no digits whatsoever. It has a large, palmate leaf with three prongs on the end of its tail. This tail is capable of performing photosynthesis, which allows Snivy to move more quickly. However, the tail will begin to droop when Snivy loses energy. This Pokémon has a calm, collected demeanor.

==In the anime==
[[File:Juniper Snivy.png|thumb|left|250px|Snivy in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Trip's Snivy]]====
{{TP|Trip|Snivy|Serperior}} debuted in ''[[BW001|In The Shadow of Zekrom!]]'', where [[Professor Juniper]] gave [[Trip]] one as his [[starter Pokémon]]. He was able to defeat [[Ash's Pikachu]] with {{m|Leaf Tornado}} in a battle they had. Eventually, when Ash and Trip met again in ''[[BW010|A Rival Battle for Club Champ!]]'', his Snivy had evolved into Servine.

====[[Ash's Snivy]]====
[[Ash's Snivy]] debuted in ''[[BW007|Snivy Plays Hard to Catch!]]''. She knows {{m|Attract}}, much to the dismay of Ash, who tried to catch her, but failed because most of his team was male. She was defeated by [[Ash's Tranquill|Pidove]] due to both of them having the same gender, and Ash successfully captured her.

====Other====
A Snivy appeared in ''[[BW109|New Places... Familiar Faces!]]'' as a [[starter Pokémon]] Professor Juniper offered for [[Nanette]]. However, she chose {{DL|Nanette|Tepig}} instead.

===Minor appearances===
Multiple Trainers' Snivy appeared in ''[[BW019|A Connoisseur's Revenge!]]'', where they were seen at a [[Poké Mart]].

A Snivy appeared in a fantasy in ''[[BW120|Ash and N: A Clash of Ideals!]]''.

==In the manga==
[[File:Cheren Snivy Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Snivy in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{main|Cheren's Snivy}}
{{main|N's Snivy}}
Snivy is also featured along with the other starter Pokémon as one of the starter Pokémon in Professor Juniper's lab. While talking on the phone to [[Fennel]], {{p|Tepig}} spilled some {{DL|Drink|Berry Juice}} on Snivy, causing him to fight with [[Tep|Tepig]]. Eventually Oshawott joined in on the commotion until the three starter Pokémon had managed to make a mess of her office, after which Juniper returned them to their [[Poké Ball]]s, commenting that she was worried that the three might be too much for their future Trainers. Snivy was given to {{adv|Cheren}} by {{adv|Bianca}} because she thought he resembled him. He first appeared in ''[[PS461|Fussing and Fighting]]''.

Professor [[Cedric Juniper]]'s Snivy was supposed to be given to new Trainers, but was liberated by {{adv|N}}. Snivy went with N, and evolved into a Servine while with N, and was then given to {{adv|White}}. She first appeared in ''[[PS479|The Case of the Missing Pokémon]]''.

===In the Be the Best! Pokémon B+W manga===
{{main|Monta's Serperior}}
Snivy is [[Monta]]'s [[starter Pokémon]] in the [[Be the Best! Pokémon B+W]] manga, a "walkthrough comic" based on the Black and White games. It later evolved into its final form.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Snivy (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U===
[[File:Snivy SSB4.png|220px|thumb|Snivy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
Snivy appears as a Pokémon released from a [[Poké Ball]] in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]. When released, it uses {{m|Razor Leaf}}, a move that it [[Game move errors|cannot legally learn]].

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Along with Ekans and {{tt|Onyx|[sic]}}, this Pokémon is considered to be a snake Pokémon, even though it has two legs. When it evolves into Serperior, however, it sheds those legs. In Smash Bros., Snivy unleashes Razor Leaf on fighters, sending sharp leaves flying and damaging anything in range.''

'''PAL''': ''Like Ekans and Onix, Snivy is known as a snake Pokémon. Unlike those Pokémon, it has two legs. When it eventually evolves into Serperior, though, it loses them. It attacks using Razor Leaf, which sends super sharp leaves flying into fighters in front of it, potentially hitting them over and over again. ''

==Game data==
[[File:PP2 Snivy.png|thumb|160px|Snivy as seen in PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond]]
===As the Player===
Snivy appears as one of the [[player character]] in [[PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond]]. She is the daughter of Queen {{p|Serperior}}, which makes her Princess of the [[Arbor Area]]. Much to her mother's dismay, she is quite rambunctious, and prefers playing and getting dirty than being elegant and proper. Upon hearing of {{OBP|Pikachu|PokéPark}} and {{p|Oshawott}}'s task to save the PokéPark, she helps them to open the portal in the Arbor Zone, on the condition that they take her with them.

Snivy is also playable in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity]]. The player may either choose to be transformed into Snivy, or have the partner be one.

==Trivia==
[[File:PokéSun May09 10.png|thumb|The three silhouettes on [[Pokémon Sunday]]]]
{{bulbanews|Gotta Meme 'em All: Genetics and Smugleaf}}
* Snivy and the other {{2v2|Black|White}} starter Pokémon were first revealed as silhouettes on the May 9, 2010 episode of [[Pokémon Sunday]]. They were later revealed in full in the June 2010 issue of [[CoroCoro]].
* Shortly after its release, much like many other [[Generation V]] Pokémon newly introduced, Snivy received the fan-made moniker, "Smugleaf". This name was picked up on and published in an article on the video gaming-focused blog [http://kotaku.com/5538319/pokemons-smugleaf-a-meme-in-the-making/ Kotaku] and later in an issue of [[Media:NZAU Magazine Scan.jpg|Official Nintendo Magazine Australia and New Zealand]], as well as its United Kingdom counterpart.
* Snivy is the only {{type|Grass}} [[starter Pokémon]] that is not listed as the first Pokémon in its [[regional Pokédex]], although it is still #001; this is because the {{p|Victini|Pokémon before it}} has a Pokédex number of #000. It is also the only Grass-type starter Pokémon that is not the first Pokémon of its generation in [[National Pokédex]] order.
* Snivy has the lowest base stat total of all {{type|Grass}} starter Pokémon.
* In {{g|Black and White}}, Snivy, along with {{p|Tepig}} and {{p|Oshawott}}, has the lowest [[experience]] yield of all Pokémon, with a base value of 28. This was done specifically for the first two battles of the games, so the player's starter wouldn't level up after defeating [[Bianca]] and thus have a level advantage over [[Cheren]].
** From {{g|Black 2 and White 2}} onward, their base experience yield was raised to 62 to bring them in line with the other [[starter Pokémon]] in the series.

===Origin===
Snivy may be based on a variety of green {{wp|vine snake}} species with a pointed snout, including ''{{wp|Oxybelis fulgidus}}'', ''{{wp|Ahaetulla nasuta}}'', and ''{{wp|Ahaetulla prasina}}''. Snivy's color scheme is similar to its species' possible namesake, the {{wp|smooth green snake|grass snake}}. The Pokémon's combination of snake- and lizard-like features is also similar to that of the {{wp|Florida sand skink}}, a lizard that resembles a snake with small, stubby legs. The shape of its head, body, and the protrusions on its shoulders may be based on the {{wp|Strelitzia|bird of paradise}} or {{wp|Heliconia|false bird of paradise}} flowers. [[Ken Sugimori]] has said that Snivy, Servine, and Serperior are based on French royalty, specifically mentioning the anime ''{{wp|The Rose of Versailles}}'' as inspiration.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20101228065540/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index5.html (archived link)</ref>

====Name origin====
Snivy is a combination of ''snake'' and ''ivy''. It may also involve ''snide'', ''sly'', ''snark'' (a snide remark), or ''snicker'' (a sly or snide laugh).

Tsutarja may be a combination of ツタ ''tsuta'' ({{wp|Parthenocissus tricuspidata|Japanese ivy}}) and 蛇 ''ja'' (snake).
