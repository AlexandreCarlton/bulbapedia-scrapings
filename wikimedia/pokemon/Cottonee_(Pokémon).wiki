'''Cottonee''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''モンメン''' ''Monmen'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a pure {{type|Grass}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Whimsicott}} when exposed to a [[Sun Stone]].

==Biology==
Cottonee is a white, circular Pokémon. It has white, puffy sections on the top of its head and its underside. Behind it is a green, star shaped section similar to the area where a plant connects to its produce. It has orange, oval-shaped eyes, and furled, notched leaves on the sides of its body.

Cottonee is blown around by the wind because of its lightweight composition. The only circumstance in which it cannot be blown by wind is when it has been soaked by rain, which weighs it down and makes it soggy. Afterwards, this Pokémon will stay under a tree until it dries, so that it may be blown by the wind again. [[BW029|During the mating season]], Cottonee blow in the wind in large groups. Its cotton can be used as a defensive mechanism that aids its self-defense.

* Cottonee has the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} of all {{type|Grass}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Cottonee is based on a ball of {{wp|cotton}} and two leaves of {{wp|lamb's ear}}, though the way it lets the wind move it is similar to {{wp|dandelion}} seeds and {{wp|clouds}}. Cottonee also has the appearance of a sheep head.

====Name origin====
Cottonee may be a corruption of ''cottony'' or ''cottonweed'' or a combination of ''cotton'' and ''wee'' (small).

Monmen is a corruption of 木綿 ''momen'' (cotton).
