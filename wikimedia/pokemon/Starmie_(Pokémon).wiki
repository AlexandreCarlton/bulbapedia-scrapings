'''Starmie''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''スターミー''' ''Starmie'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Staryu}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]].

==Biology==
Starmie is a violet sea star-like Pokémon with a gold formation on its front. Starmie's jewel core, which can glow in seven colors, has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. There is second set of semi-attached arms on its back, which are able to spin 360°. Starmie can emit electrical waves from the core that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. It can sometimes launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in [[Pokémon Snap]].

The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication inside the species. However, Starmie’s core is most commonly seen as red in color. As seen in [[EP007|the anime]], the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious, and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokémon to be {{pkmn2|extraterrestrial}}. Starmie is rarely seen in the wild, but can be found in the deepest parts of the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|ocean}}. It is {{DL|Lumineon (Pokémon)|Lumineon}}'s favourite food.

==Trivia==
* Despite being a genderless Pokémon, Staryu and Starmie were programmed to learn Egg moves in {{2v2|Gold|Silver}}; however, due to being genderless, these were unobtainable. This was fixed in {{v2|Crystal}}.
** Also, they are one of the few genderless Pokémon able to learn {{m|Attract}} in [[Generation II]], along with {{p|Mew}}.
* In the Japanese exclusive Pokémon Stadium, Starmie seems to have originally been a lot more rubbery than it is now, as its limbs stretch when it's hit.

===Origin===
It appears to be a stylized {{wp|seastar}}, with a second set of arms on its back similar to a {{wp|crown of thorns starfish}}. Starmie also bears resemblance to the Mesopotamian goddess {{wp|Inanna#Iconography|Inanna's iconography}}.

====Name origin====
Starmie is derived from ''star'' (referring to its shape) and ''mie'', which involves 珠 ''mi'' (''gem'' or ''jewel''), referring to its core. In English, ''Mie'' is considered a corruption of ''me'' (the personal pronoun), in opposition to the ''yu'' (you) in {{p|Staryu}}. This pun is not present in their Japanese names; while Starmie shares its name in both languages, Staryu's Japanese name is Hitodeman (roughly "starfish man").
