'''Regigigas''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レジギガス''' ''Regigigas'') is a {{type|Normal}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is the [[trio master]] of [[Hoenn]]'s [[Legendary titans]].

==Biology==
[[File:Regigigas orb.png|thumb|left|250px|Regigigas in its slumber]]
Regigigas is a large, white, golem-like Pokémon with seven black circular "eyes" arranged in a specific pattern. The pattern is Regigigas's way of showing its anger; its eyes glow red when it is provoked. It has six spots that are apart from its eyes, which appear to be gemstones. These gemstones seem to represent the other three Regis, with red gems representing {{p|Regirock}}, blue gems indicating {{p|Regice}}, and silver gems representing {{p|Registeel}}. It has long arms, with three fairly human-like white fingers, and short legs that end in large mossy bushes instead of feet. Regigigas has large yellow bands on its shoulders and wrists, with a sloping section on its chest that appears to be its head and is also yellow. Its body is covered in black stripes, and it has moss growing in its back and feet. According to Sinnoh legend, Regigigas's strength enables it to move continents.

Regigigas is a skilled craftsman. It created golems out of inanimate objects and brought them to life. Regigigas is also capable of controlling these [[Legendary titans]], even if they already belong to a {{pkmn|Trainer}}. It can also survive extreme conditions as it is able to work with the boiling temperatures of magma (1300-2400&nbsp;°F [700-1300&nbsp;°C]) as well as frigid ice (-328&nbsp;°F [-200&nbsp;°C]). When Regigigas is disturbed from its slumber, it goes on a rampage and shoots powerful beams of energy. When it is befriended, however, it is calm and gentle, as seen in ''[[DP129|Pillars of Friendship!]]''. It is able to crush targets by using its [[signature move]], {{m|Crush Grip}}.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===
[[File:Regigigas anime.png|thumb|250px|Regigigas in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
====Major appearances====
Regigigas debuted in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. It lives in a temple in the mountains of [[Ten'i Village]] and had been asleep for centuries, subsequently having moss growing on its body. However, when [[Zero]] entered the [[Reverse World]] and began shattering pillars of ice within it, the glacier in front of Regigigas' temple suffered catastrophic explosions and began moving. This disturbed its slumber, rousing it into action. When [[Dawn's Buneary]] and {{TP|Dawn|Swinub}} failed to stop the glacier with the help of a large group of wild Pokémon, Regigigas appeared and commanded a herd of dozens of {{p|Mamoswine}} to hold the glacier back. Once the crisis was resolved, Regigigas returned to its temple. It was last seen using {{m|Hyper Beam}} on {{TRT}} during the ending credits.

Regigigas made its main series debut in ''[[DP129|Pillars of Friendship!]]'' at the [[Snowpoint Temple]]. [[J]] wanted to steal it, and a result, it was rudely awakened. It went on a rampage afterwards, using Hyper Beam on anything. It even used {{m|Confuse Ray}} to control [[Pyramid King Brandon]]'s set of {{TP|Brandon|legendary titans}} to help it. At the end of the episode, it healed Brandon and his titans using {{m|Hidden Power}} to restore them from their petrification. It was then taken back to the temple to return to its slumber.

====Minor appearances====
A Regigigas appeared as a part of Meowth's [[boss fantasy]] in ''[[DP173|Dealing With a Fierce Double Ditto Drama!]]'', alongside Giratina.

A Regigigas appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''.

A Regigigas appeared in the beginning of ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', where it was summoned by a {{an|Hoopa}} Unbound in [[Dahara City]] one hundred years prior to the events of the movie, alongside a {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}}. The three fought Hoopa, but were easily defeated and sent back through portals to their original homes.

Whilst in her trance, Platinum unconsciously rolled over an empty [[Poké Ball]] to the creature, and it ended up in her bag before choosing to join {{adv|Diamond}} in an effort to stop {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}'s clash. It was later named "Reg."

* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Regigigas appears as a statue, along with four {{p|Bronzong}} and four {{p|Hitmonlee}}, in [[Aegis Cave]]. When the player's team and [[Team Charm]] reach them, the statues come to life and battle the two teams. After being defeated, Regigigas rises again and smashes the ground with its fist, causing the earth outside to heave up and reveal the entrance to the [[Concealed Ruins]]. Afterwards, Regigigas can be battled again and recruited.

==Trivia==
* Due to {{a|Slow Start|its Ability}} weakening it, Regigigas has more in common with {{p|Slaking}} than it does with other [[Legendary Pokémon]]. They share the {{t|Normal}} type, the same base stat total of 670, the same base {{stat|Attack}} stat of 160, and {{Abilities}} that limit their power.
** Regigigas and {{p|Slaking}} also have the highest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.
* Regigigas is the only one of the [[Legendary titans]] not to have its type in its name.
** Regigigas is also the only one of the Legendary titans that does not use the remix of the Legendary titan battle theme in {{v2|Platinum}} or {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. Instead, it uses the Sinnoh Legendary battle theme, much like in {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}}.
*** In {{2v2|Black|White|2}}, however, the remix of the Legendary titan battle theme is used.
* Regigigas is the only Pokémon that can learn TMs outside of moves it learns by leveling up, but cannot learn {{m|Protect}}.
* In Platinum, by hacking to obtain {{ball|Cherish}}s, it is possible to trick the game into opening [[Rock Peak Ruins|Rock Peak]], [[Iceberg Ruins|Iceberg]], and [[Iron Ruins]]: by catching the in-game Regigigas in a Cherish Ball, the game thinks the Regigigas was obtained at a Nintendo event.	
* In [[Generation IV]], Regigigas is the only Pokémon required to acquire the [[Diploma]] that cannot be obtained without the use of [[Generation III]] games or an event, even with all Generation IV titles. This limitation occurs because Regigigas cannot be obtained without the use of the other Legendary titans, which in turn cannot be obtained without either importing them from Generation III or obtaining them in Platinum with an event Regigigas.
* Regigigas is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] Normal-type Pokémon.
* Regigigas is the only [[Generation IV]] Legendary Pokémon whose Attack stat is higher than its {{stat|Special Attack}} stat.
* Regigigas is the lowest-leveled Legendary Pokémon that can be encountered in the wild, being level 1 when fought in {{game|Platinum}}.

===Origin===
Regigigas may be based on the {{wp|golem}}s of Hebrew legend. The legends cast them as servants of higher powers and are said to have writing on their heads. When the writing is removed, the creature would be weakened.

Regigigas also seems to have parallels to the Legendary Golem of Prague, whose immense power also intimidated people. This ultimately resulted in it being overrun and sealed away in an attic. Conversely, Regigigas was sealed in a basement.

====Name origin====
Regigigas is a combination of ''regis'', Latin for ''royal'', and γίγας ''gigas'', Greek for ''giant''.
