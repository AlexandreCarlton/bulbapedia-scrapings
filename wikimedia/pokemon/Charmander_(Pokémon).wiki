'''Charmander''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヒトカゲ''' ''Hitokage'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Charmeleon}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Charizard}} starting at level 36.

Along with {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Squirtle}}, Charmander is one of three [[starter Pokémon]] of [[Kanto]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].

==Biology==
Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body. Its underside from the chest down and soles are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. Charmander has blue eyes. Its arms and legs are short with four fingers and three clawed toes. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail, and has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies if its flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain.

Charmander can be found in hot, {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountainous areas}}. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. As shown in [[Pokémon Snap]], Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food.

==In the anime==
===In the [[Pokémon anime|main series]]===
====Major appearances====
[[File:Ash Charmander M20.png|thumb|220px|Charmander in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
=====[[Ash's Charmander]]=====
In ''[[EP011|Charmander - The Stray Pokémon]]'', {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} came across a Charmander which had been abandoned by its Trainer, [[Damian]], who only cared about raising strong Pokémon. At first, Charmander refused to leave the spot it was at, believing Damian would return for it. However, when a rainstorm picked up, Charmander grew ill and Ash took it to a [[Pokémon Center]]. Charmander realized that Damian was no good, and joined up with Ash. It has since evolved into {{p|Charmeleon}}, and then {{AP|Charizard}}.

=====[[Zippo]]=====
[[Ritchie]] owned a Charmander named [[Zippo]], which debuted in ''[[EP078|A Friend In Deed]]''. It was later revealed to have evolved into Charmeleon during ''[[EP221|A Parent Trapped!]]''.

=====[[Team Go-Getters]]=====
A Charmander starred in ''[[SS019|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters out of the Gate!]]'' as the leader of Team Go-Getters.

=====[[Alain's Charmander]]=====
A Charmander appeared in a flashback in ''[[SS029|Mega Evolution Special I]]'' as the unevolved form of [[Alain]]'s {{p|Charizard}}.

=====[[Trevor's Charmander]]=====
A Charmander appeared in ''[[XY039|Summer of Discovery!]]'', under the ownership of {{an|Trevor}}. It was later revealed to have evolved into Charmeleon during ''[[XY086|A Legendary Photo Op!]]'' and into Charizard during ''[[XY125|A League of His Own!]]''.

=====Other=====
In ''[[SS014|Journey to the Starting Line!]]'', {{OBP|Gilbert|SS014}} was intended to start his journey as a [[Pokémon Trainer]], but the trio of Kanto Starter Pokémon were scared off when [[Ash's Tauros]] stampeded through {{an|Professor Oak}}'s house. Professor Oak, {{Tracey}}, {{Delia}}, and Gilbert split up in order to find the three missing Pokémon. The Charmander was the first one to be found.

Another Charmander was seen with Professor Oak in ''[[AG071|A Six Pack Attack!]]'' along with a {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Squirtle}}. Yet another was seen in ''[[AG133|The Right Place and The Right Mime]]'', along with another {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{TP|May|Squirtle}}. Professor Oak showed off yet another Charmander along with a Bulbasaur and Squirtle during the [[Kanto Fair]].

A Charmander appeared in ''[[BW116|The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!]]'', under the ownership of the [[Kanto Fair Host]]. Seeing it inspired Ash to bring his Charizard back onto his team.

====Minor appearances====
Charmander was mentioned in the first episode of the anime, ''[[EP001|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]'', as one of the three starter Pokémon new Trainers in Pallet Town can choose from. Ash dreamed of owning one, although it was his last choice of a starter coming after {{p|Squirtle}} and {{p|Bulbasaur}}. However, when he arrived at Oak's lab, he found out it was too late, as another Trainer who started the same day had already taken it.

Multiple Charmander appeared in ''[[EP015|Battle Aboard the St. Anne]]''.

A Charmander was seen in a [[Pokémon Center]] in ''[[EP027|Hypno's Naptime]]''.

====[[Red's Charmander]]====
Charmander was one of the three Pokémon Professor Oak gave {{OBP|Red|Origins}} and {{OBP|Blue|Origins}} to choose from to start their journey, with Red choosing Charmander. It later evolved into a {{p|Charmeleon}} between ''[[PO01|File 1: Red]]'' and ''[[PO02|File 2: Cubone]]'' and then a {{p|Charizard}} between ''[[PO02|File 2: Cubone]]'' and ''[[PO03|File 3: Giovanni]]''.

====Other====
Another Charmander appeared in ''File 3: Giovanni'' at Silph Co.

[[Giovanni]] was shown to have once had a Charmander during a flashback in ''[[PO03|File 3: Giovanni]]''.

===In [[Pokémon Generations]]===
A Charmander appeared in the opening sequence for ''[[PG01|The Adventure]]''.

==In the manga==
[[File:X Salamè Charmander.png|thumb|220px|right|Charmander in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] manga===
{{main|Ash's Charmander}}
{{Ash}}'s Charmander makes a few appearances in the manga [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]].

The capture of Ash's Charmander diverges considerably from the anime. In the manga, [[Damian]] seems to have abandoned his Charmander at the beginning of the chapter ''[[ET07|Pikachu's Excellent Adventure]]'', but it turns out that he had just been injured and went to the hospital.

Ash is shown to own a Charmander despite this, his own Charmander first appears in ''[[ET08|You Gotta Have Friends]]''. Ash's Charmander's capture is not shown in the manga, instead, when Charmander first appears from its [[Poké Ball]], it is simply stated that "Ash has been busy since the last comic".

Ash's Charmander reappears as a {{p|Charizard}} in the chapter ''[[ET13|The Indigo Finals]]'' at the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]]. In this chapter, Charizard battles [[Zippo|Charley]], [[Ritchie]]'s own Charizard.

===In the [[Magical Pokémon Journey]] manga===
{{main|Peanut's Charmander}}
{{main|Mandy (MPJ)}}
In [[Magical Pokémon Journey]], the sickly Trainer [[Peanut]] owns an aggressive Charmander. Peanut's Charmander first appears in the chapter ''[[PPP11|Charmander's Peanut]]''.

Mandy is a female Charmander from the Magical Pokémon Journey manga.

===In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga===
{{main|Blue's Charmander}}
{{main|Salamè}}
Charmander debuted in the first round of the {{chap|Red, Green & Blue}}, ''[[PS001|A Glimpse of the Glow]]'', where one appeared in a fantasy explanation of Red and as one of {{adv|Blue}}'s first Pokémon, received from his grandfather {{adv|Professor Oak}}. He has since evolved into {{p|Charmeleon}} before facing [[Brock]] of [[Pewter City]], and then to {{p|Charizard}} before the [[Silph Co.]] battles against [[Team Rocket]]. The major powerhouse of his team with his newly learned {{m|Blast Burn}} attack, his battle skills (able to defeat {{adv|Red}}'s [[Poli]]whirl easily even before evolving) are complimented by his fast flight, for which he was traded to Red twice, during both the {{chap|Gold, Silver & Crystal}} and the {{chap|FireRed & LeafGreen}}. It is worth noting that, as Charmeleon, he was accidentally traded to Red many years earlier.

Another Charmander appeared as a silhouette when {{adv|Green}} explains about {{p|Mew}} in ''[[PS017|The Jynx Jinx]]''.

After X's [[Marisso]] lost to him in a battle {{adv|X}} decided to take him and named him Salamè in ''[[PAXY09|Chespin Sows the Seeds of Change]]''. He later evolved into a Charmeleon alongside Marisso who evolved into a {{p|Quilladin}} in ''[[PAXY22|Quilladin Stands]]''.

===In the [[Pokémon Pocket Monsters]] manga===
{{main|Green's Charmander}}
In the [[Pokémon Pocket Monsters]] manga series, {{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}}'s rival, {{OBP|Green|Pocket Monsters}}, chose Charmander as his [[starter Pokémon]]. Green's Charmander is mischievous and has a rivalry with [[Red's Clefairy]].

Green's Charmander has evolved into {{p|Charizard}}. It seems to be able to skip the {{p|Charmeleon}} stage, as it was seen evolving directly into Charizard. Although it has devolved back to the Charmander stage, it currently seems to have permanently evolved back into Charizard.

===In the [[Pokémon Zensho]] manga===
{{main|Satoshi's Charmander (Zensho)}}
In [[Pokémon Zensho]], {{Zensho|Satoshi}} chooses Charmander as his starter Pokémon, while {{Zensho|Shigeru}} chooses a {{p|Squirtle}}.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Charmander (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
Charmander appears in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] as a trophy.

===Trophy information===
''"A Lizard Pokémon. It just downright likes hot stuff. The always-burning tail indicates its mood--waving gently when content and burning intensely when angry. If the tail were to go out, it would be the end of Charmander's life. Its tail is believed to emit steam when it rains. Charmander evolves into Charmeleon by leveling up."''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* In [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]] Charmander is one of Pikachu's best friends. After falling through the mysterious tunnel, he almost lands into a pool of molten lava only to be saved by the zone leader, {{p|Blaziken}}. He was then taken in as Blaziken's pupil and trained to become stronger. After he's been found, he journeys to the [[Meeting Place]] where he helps {{p|Piplup}} mend the balloon, and makes fireworks. He later accompanies Pikachu to the [[Sky Pavilion]] along with {{p|Piplup}} and {{p|Chikorita}} where he meets {{p|Mew}}. Once the [[Sky Prism]] has been restored, Charmander celebrates by firing off the fireworks he made.

==Trivia==
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokemon.png|thumb|250px|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Charmander as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Charmander on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.
* In the first generation, on its sprite and [[Media:004Charmander RG.png|first artwork]], Charmander's "back" is depicted as having a small line of spikes. The spikes were not shown in the sprites and artwork of later [[generation]]s. [[Blue's Charmander]] also had these spikes in the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, where the spikes were larger and easier to see. The spikes were also seen on {{PPM|Green}}'s {{TP|Green|Charmander|Charizard}} from the [[Pokémon Pocket Monsters]] manga.
* Charmander is the tallest Fire-type starter Pokémon.
* Charmander has the longest name of all unevolved [[starter Pokémon]].
* Charmander is the only Fire-type starter Pokémon that is not a member of the {{egg3|Field}}.
* Charmander, {{p|Cyndaquil}}, and their respective evolutionary lines have exactly the same base stats.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Charmander}}
Charmander appears to be predominantly {{wp|reptilian}} in origin, and may have been partially inspired by the mythical {{wp|Salamanders in folklore and legend|salamander}} (as opposed to the real-world amphibian of the same name which inspired its mythical counterpart). This salamander was a fire-spirit capable of surviving in extreme heat or flames, and it is sometimes creatively rendered or interpreted in the shape of a lizard.

Physically, Charmander has a slender body, a short nose, and a long tail, as well as other lizard-like characteristics. The fact that it does not undergo a metamorphosis stage (beyond its own evolutionary pattern) but instead grows into a larger version of itself as it matures, among other things, indicate that Charmander has more in common with reptiles (such as lizards) than with amphibians (such as real-world salamanders).

Charmander's Hidden Ability, {{a|Solar Power}}, may have drawn inspiration from the {{wp|spotted salamander}}. In July and August 2010, this species was identified as the first known {{wp|Photosynthesis|photosynthetic}} vertebrate animal, capable of converting energy from sunlight.

====Name origin====
Charmander is a portmanteau of the words ''char'' (to burn) and ''salamander''.

Hitokage comes from 火蜥蜴 (salamander): 火 ''hi'' (fire) and 蜥蜴 ''tokage'' (lizard).
