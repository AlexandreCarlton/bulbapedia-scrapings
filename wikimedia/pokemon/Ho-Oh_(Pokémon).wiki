'''Ho-Oh''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ホウオウ''' ''Houou'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is often considered to be closely related to {{p|Lugia}} as a [[Tower duo|duo]], even sometimes as its polar opposite. [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions|Silver]] represents Lugia as "guardian of the seas", and [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions|Gold]] represents Ho-Oh as "guardian of the skies". Ho-Oh is also the [[trio master]] of the [[Legendary beasts]].

Ho-Oh is the [[game mascot]] of {{game3|Gold and Silver|Pokémon Gold|s}} and its remake {{game3|HeartGold and SoulSilver|Pokémon HeartGold|s}}, appearing on the boxart of both.

==Biology==
Ho-Oh is an avian Pokémon resembling a phoenix and a peacock. Its feathers are predominantly gold and red, with yellow tail-feathers, a white underside, and green feathers at the tip of its wings. Ho-Oh has a green stripe on its neck, a yellow beak, black rings around its red eyes, and a feathered, yellow crest on its head. Ho-Oh's wings are prismatic, causing it to trail a rainbow behind it. It has darkly colored feet and legs with four toes and long talons.

Ho-Oh has a mythical power to resurrect the dead. Ho-Oh was the only known Pokémon to learn {{m|Sacred Fire}}, its former [[signature move]]. It is said that when it flies its huge wings create bright, colorful rainbows. The rare few who bear witness to Ho-Oh are promised an eternal happiness. Ho-Oh used to perch at the top of the [[Bell Tower]] until the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] was destroyed by fire. It now presumably flies through the world's skies in search of a Trainer with a pure heart.

==In the anime==
===In the main series===
[[File:Ho-Oh anime.png|250px|thumb|Ho-Oh in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
According to the {{pkmn|anime}}, Ho-Oh lived in the [[Bell Tower|Tin Tower]] in ancient times. When a war broke out, burning both the Tin Tower and the Brass Tower down, it created {{p|Raikou}}, {{p|Entei}}, and {{p|Suicune}}, and all four disappeared. Later, a new Tin Tower was erected, but Ho-Oh since then has never come back for sure. A {{m|Sacred Fire|sacred flame}} from Ho-Oh burns in the [[Dragon's Den]]; it was obtained during the same war.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Ho-Oh (anime)]]=====
A Ho-Oh appeared to {{Ash}} at the end of [[EP001|the first episode]], flying alongside a rainbow across the sky after the thunderstorm.

After competing in the [[Silver Conference]], Ash saw Ho-Oh flying towards [[Hoenn]]. This encouraged him to get over his depression at his loss and continue his journey.

Ho-Oh was seen flying into the sunset at the end of ''[[AG178|Battling the Enemy Within!]]''. This time, {{an|Brock}}, {{an|May}}, [[Max]], [[Scott]], and {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} saw Ho-Oh as well.

Ho-Oh reappeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', which is based in a continuity different from the main series.

====Minor appearances====
A Ho-Oh appeared in a flashback during ''[[EP265|Pop Goes The Sneasel]]''.

Ho-Oh had cameo appearances in the opening sequences of ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]'', ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', and ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''. In ''Lucario and the Mystery of Mew'', {{OBP|Mew|M08}} also {{m|transform}}ed into Ho-Oh.

===In Pokémon Generations===
A wild Ho-Oh appeared in [[Ecruteak City]] in ''[[PG06|The Reawakening]]''.
{{-}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Ho-Oh Adventures.png|thumb|left|200px|Ho-Oh in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
In [[Pokémon Adventures]], Ho-Oh first appeared as a silhouette in ''[[PS039|Just a Spearow Carrier]]''. It appeared again as a silhouette in ''[[PS059|Hitmonlee, Baby! (One More Time)]]'', when Green was explaining to {{adv|Bill}} that she believes the Elite Four were the ones who controlled it to capture her. It was used by the [[Masked Man]] to kidnap children showing remarkable talent in his scheme to capture {{adv|Celebi}}, including {{adv|Green}} and {{adv|Silver}}, six years prior to the start of the entire manga. Prior to the events of the GSC saga, Pryce had lost his control over Ho-Oh, and thus attacked the [[Bell Tower|Tin Tower]] using [[Team Rocket]] to prompt Ho-Oh to return to [[Ecruteak City]]. Ho-Oh was later seen at [[Indigo Plateau]] under Pryce's control, alongside {{p|Lugia}}, wreaking havoc and destruction. It was then lent to [[Karen]] and [[Will]] to fight Green with alongside {{p|Lugia}}, and nearly defeated her [[Legendary birds]], but both of them were eventually brought back to their senses and freed.

===In the Pokémon Gotta Catch 'Em All manga===
Ho-Oh appeared in [[GDZ65]].

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
Ho-Oh appeared in ''[[PM090|The Legendary Ho-oh!!]]'' and [[PMHGSS02]].

==Other appearances==
[[File:Ho-Oh SSBB.png|220px|thumb|Ho-Oh in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]===
When released from a [[Poké Ball]], Ho-Oh unleashes a spiral of {{m|Sacred Fire}} that deals massive amounts of damage to any opponent caught in it. However, it appears very rarely.

====Melee trophy information====

''As it soars around the skies of the world, this Rainbow Pokemon leaves a trail of rainbows and myths in its wake. Its signature move is called Sacred Fire, and it is believed to appear only before trainers who are pure of heart. If you see a trainer with Ho-oh, you can assume that catching it took a lot of work.''

====Brawl trophy information====

''"A Rainbow Pokémon. On sparkling wings of seven colors, Ho-Oh leaves a rainbow behind as it flies. Legend says that Ho-Oh suppressed a war that scorched the land in ancient times. Its attack Sacred Fire can melt ice in an instant and also damage the target with burns. Ho-Oh will show its solemn figure only for the most righteous Trainers."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===

Ho-Oh returns as an occasional stage hazard in the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Blazing Chamber}} of the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. Rarely appearing, it makes the flames supporting the platforms flare up with higher intensity, likely KOing any characters unfortunate enough to be on the platforms at the time.
====Trophy Information====
''This Pokémon flies through the skies, trailing rainbows from its wings, and is said to promise eternal happiness to all who see it. Supposedly, it appears every once in a while in the Fire-type Elite Four Trainer's room in the Kalos Pokémon League stage. Its screams cause pillars of fire to rise all the way to the ceiling.''

==Trivia==
* Ho-Oh is the first {{cat|Generation II Pokémon}} to be shown in the anime, making it the first sign that the franchise would ever expand beyond 151 Pokémon. It is seen at the end of the [[EP001|very first episode]] of the anime. However, the [[Pokédex]] does not know what it is.
** Aside from the opening theme song, which featured {{p|Mewtwo}}, {{p|Mew}}, and the [[Legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]], Ho-Oh was also the first [[Legendary Pokémon]] ever seen in the {{pkmn|anime}}.
* Ho-Oh's name is a {{wp|palindrome}}.
* Ho-Oh has the highest base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all {{type|Fire}} Pokémon and is tied with {{p|Lugia}} for the highest base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* It is indirectly implied in a myth in {{5v2|Gold|Silver|Crystal|HeartGold|SoulSilver}} that Ho-Oh revived {{p|Raikou}}, {{p|Entei}}, and {{p|Suicune}} upon their original deaths. 
* Ho-Oh's Hidden Ability {{a|Regenerator}} reflects a {{wp|Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix}}'s ability to be reborn from its ashes.

===Origin===
Ho-Oh may be based on the legend of the {{wp|Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix}}, specifically the {{wp|Fenghuang}}, the immortal phoenix of China from which it derives its name. It may also based on the {{wp|Huma bird}}, a Legendary bird that is said to never rest, living its entire life flying continuously, and resurrects itself and others in its own ashes and flames. It is a symbol of fortune and friendship and will bestow happiness to anyone who simply glimpses it. Many cultures view the Phoenix and Huma as symbols of resurrection; this is seen in Ho-Oh, which was reborn rising from [[Sacred Ash|its own ashes]] and had a hand in resurrecting {{p|Suicune}}, {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Entei}}. It may also be based on many other {{wp|firebird}}s; some examples are the {{wp|Three-legged crow#Japan|three-legged bird}}, {{wp|Simurgh}}, and the {{wp|Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Ember Bird}}. It also is similar to the rainbow-feathered bird god {{wp|Achiyalabopa}}.

====Name origin====
Ho-Oh and Houou are alternate transcriptions of the Chinese phoenix known as a {{wp|Fenghuang|Fènghuáng}} (鳳凰), via its Japanese on'yomi name ''Hōō''. The ''ou'' may also refer to 皇 ''ō'' (emperor) or 王 ''ō'' (king).
