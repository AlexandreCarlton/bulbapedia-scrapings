'''Jirachi''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ジラーチ''' ''Jirachi'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Psychic}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
Jirachi is a small, white, humanoid Pokémon. It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third eye, known as its "true" eye. Additionally, it has a normal pair of circular eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a blue tag, known as a "wish tag". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from this Pokémon's back, resembling comet tails.

Jirachi hibernates for extensive periods, forming a protective crystalline shell as it sleeps. However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep if it is in danger. It awakens for seven days every thousand years, but can also waken if sung to by a voice of purity. During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, [[M06|in the anime]], Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, Jirachi's wishes are granted by writing on the three tags located on its head. Due to only having three tags, Jirachi can only grant three wishes. The anime further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the [[Millennium Comet]], and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. Although it is extremely rare, Jirachi can be found in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}}. Jirachi is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Doom Desire}}.

==In the anime==
[[File:Jirachi anime.png|thumb|250px|Jirachi in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
===Major appearances===

====[[Jirachi (M06)]]====
Jirachi played a major role in ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]''. It will only awaken during the week of the [[Millennium Comet]], and if there is a partner that can be its friend. [[Max]] filled that role in the movie. However, [[Butler]] wanted to use Jirachi's powers to awaken {{p|Groudon}}. When Butler gained control of Jirachi, he forced it to use its power, inadvertently creating [[Groudon (M06)|a fake Groudon]] that would devour everything in sight with its liquid-like tentacles. With the help of Butler, Max, and {{Ash}}, Jirachi managed to destroy the Groudon with {{m|Doom Desire}}. It then went back to sleep.

====Other====
Jirachi made its main series debut in ''[[BW132|Searching for a Wish!]]''. A young girl named [[Gemma]] had been in pursuit of Jirachi, since she wanted it to grant her wish to restore her valley to the vibrant land it once was. In the end, Jirachi granted her wish.

A Jirachi appeared in ''[[PK26|Pikachu, What's This Key?]]''.

===Minor appearances===
A Jirachi had a very brief cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

A Jirachi made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', where it was seen levitating over a {{p|Groudon}}.

A Jirachi made a cameo appearance in the ending credits in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

==In the manga==

===In the movie adaptations===

Jirachi appears in ''{{ma|Jirachi: Wish Maker}}''.

===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===
{{spoilers}}
Jirachi is the featured legend of the {{chap|Emerald}}, first appearing in ''[[PS313|You Need to Chill Out, Regice]]''. The seven days Jirachi was awake coincided with the seven days of preview events for the {{ho|Battle Frontier}} before it officially opened. {{adv|Emerald}} was dispatched to the Battle Frontier by {{adv|Professor Oak}} to capture Jirachi, because Oak knew that Jirachi was but one way to reverse the event that [[PS302|turned five of his Pokédex Holders into stone]]. Jirachi officially debuted in ''[[PS314|A Sketchy Smattering of Smeargle]]'', where it evaded capture attempts by Emerald and [[Guile Hideout]], another character that was after Jirachi.

As the ''Emerald'' chapter progressed, the Frontier Brains discovered that Battle Frontier's owner [[Scott]] had known about Professor Oak's research on Jirachi, and wanted to reserve one of Jirachi's three wish tags for himself. In ''[[PS324|A Cheeky Charizard Change-Up II]]'', Guile Hideout captured Jirachi before any of the Frontier Brains were able to track it down. Guile then advanced to the top of the [[Battle Tower]], and [[PS329|after finding out how to get Jirachi to listen to one's wish]], used the first wish tag to summon a powerful sea monster that would submerge the Battle Frontier. Guile then discarded Jirachi, thinking that it was no longer of use. This gave Emerald the chance to make the wish that would de-petrify the five Pokédex Holders, as instructed by {{adv|Gold}}. However, it didn't appear to work.

After Emerald re-evaluated his relationship with Pokémon in ''[[PS333|The Final Battle VI]]'', Jirachi finally listened to his wish and de-petrified the five Pokédex Holders. This intrigued Guile, who took Jirachi back and commanded its {{m|Doom Desire}} in an attempt to eliminate the Pokédex Holders and use the final wish tag. However, Guile was eventually defeated, and the sea monster that he summoned was destroyed by a combination of the "ultimate attacks" that all the Pokédex Holders' starter Pokémon had learned. In ''[[PS337|Epilogue]]'', Scott made the wish he had reserved: to attract at least a hundred thousand visitors to the Battle Frontier on its opening day. Emerald expressed his gratitude and bid farewell to Jirachi as it returned to its thousand-year slumber.

===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===
A Jirachi appeared in [[PMDP29]].

==In the TCG==
{{main|Jirachi (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:Jirachi SSBB.png|220px|thumb|Jirachi in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
Jirachi appears as a rare Poké Ball Pokémon in its first appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series. The chance of it appearing is 1 in 493 (the amount of Pokémon in the [[Generation IV]] [[National Pokédex]]). Like the other "secret" Pokémon, it drops rare items instead of just flying away. In Jirachi's case, the items are stickers.

====Trophy information====
''A Wish Pokémon. It's said to awaken for seven days once every thousand years, with the ability to grant any wish asked of it. It is truly a Pokémon of which dreams are made. In combat it uses its wish power to attack. Its attack, {{m|Doom Desire}}, which causes light to rain down from the heavens to do tremendous damage, is especially powerful. ''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Jirachi appears as a trophy.

====Trophy information====
''Since Jirachi is only awake for seven days every one thousand years, it's an even bigger sleeper than Snorlax! It can't just be sleeping the whole time, though. It's probably hard at work deep in the land of dreams, strengthening its ability to grant people's wishes. If it detects danger while asleep, it can fight without even waking up!''

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, [[Team Aqua]] leader [[Archie]] uses Jirachi's power to create a Kyogre monster, whereas in the anime movie ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', former [[Team Magma]] member [[Butler]] uses Jirachi's power to create a Groudon monster.
* Jirachi was the first Pokémon to be distributed via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. Previously, only the [[event item]]s needed to obtain {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} had been distributed via Wi-Fi.
* Jirachi is the only [[Generation III]] Pokémon that cannot be obtained in any of the [[Hoenn]]-based games without an event.
* Jirachi is the only [[Generation III]] {{pkmn2|Legendary}} or [[Mythical Pokémon]] that has [[List of Pokémon that do not appear in any regional Browser|not been featured]] in any of the Ranger games.
* Although Jirachi is genderless in the main games, it is referred to as male in {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}.
* Despite being legitimately obtainable in earlier games, {{Shiny}} Jirachi were previously locked out of [[Generation VI]]'s Wi-Fi features prior to an update; this makes Jirachi the only Pokémon to have undergone this kind of issue.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Jirachi}}
Jirachi's design and ability of granting wishes probably refer to the habit of "wishing upon a star", so that the wish will come true. Considering its humanoid appearance and ability to grant wishes, it is also possible that it was inspired by Arabic myths about {{wp|genie}}s, or djinn. In some myths, imprisoned genies would grant wishes to the person who released them. The tags of paper on its head are a reference toward the paper strips (短冊, tanzaku) written on {{wp|Tanabata}}.

====Name origin====
Jirachi is derived from желать ''zhelatʹ<!--leave extra apostrophe-->'' (Russian for ''wish''). It may also involve 幸 ''sachi'' (wish, happiness, or fortune).
