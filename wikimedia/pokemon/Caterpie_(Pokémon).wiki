'''Caterpie''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''キャタピー ''' ''Caterpie'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Metapod}} starting at [[level]] 7, which evolves into {{p|Butterfree}} starting at level 10.

==Biology==
[[File:Caterpie emitting stench.png|thumb|left|250px|Caterpie emitting a terrible stench]]
Caterpie is a Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar. There are yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its body, which resemble its large yellow eyes. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna ({{wp|osmeterium}}) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. This structure and the large eye-shaped markings help to startle predators. Its feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.

Caterpie will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in thick silk. It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as seen in [[EP003|the anime]]. Its primary diet is vegetation, and its voracious appetite causes it to eat leaves larger than itself. According to [[Pokémon Adventures]], its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}.

===In [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] manga===
{{main|Ash's Caterpie}}
{{Ash}}'s Caterpie appears in the manga series [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]].

Caterpie is the second wild Pokémon that Ash captures in the manga. It was caught in ''[[ET01|Pikachu, I See You!]]''. It evolves twice in ''[[ET02|Play Misty For Me]]''—first into {{p|Metapod}} while Ash is showing off his Pokémon to {{an|Misty}}, and then into {{p|Butterfree}} during his Gym battle against Misty.

Ash is not shown releasing his Butterfree in the manga, although it is not seen after ''[[ET04|Haunting My Dreams]]''.

Caterpie made its main appearance in ''[[PS049|As Gastly as Before]]''.

Caterpie then followed Yellow to where she and {{adv|Blue}} were training, next to the [[Rock Tunnel]]. It took Yellow a whole day to properly catch this Caterpie with a Poké Ball, but once she prevailed, Yellow welcomed Caterpie to her team and called it "Kitty". It then became one of Yellow's most useful Pokémon, whose string was commonly used to make floaters. However, in the battle against [[Lance]], Yellow did not have a [[Pokédex]], which she needed to stop her Pokémon from evolving, and so Kitty evolved into {{p|Metapod}} and then into {{p|Butterfree}} right afterwards.

==Trivia==
* Caterpie was both the first Pokémon to be captured and the first Pokémon to [[Evolution|evolve]] in the anime.
* Caterpie shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Wurmple}}. They are both known as the Worm Pokémon.
* Until the release of {{game|Platinum}}, when it became able to learn {{m|Bug Bite}}, Caterpie was unable to do anything to a {{t|Ghost}} type outside of {{m|Struggle|struggling}} except {{m|String Shot|lower its Speed}}. It shares this trait with its evolution, {{p|Metapod}}. This is also true for {{p|Weedle}}, and its evolution, {{p|Kakuna}}, against {{t|Steel}} types before {{game|Platinum}} was released.
** Due to this, it was impossible to complete a [[Generation I]] game using only Caterpie or Metapod, since Struggle couldn't hit Ghost types at the time.
* In the anime and in Pokémon Adventures, Caterpie holds the record as the Pokémon who takes the least time to evolve twice, taking only [[BW130|one episode]] in the anime and [[PS89|one chapter]] in Pokémon Adventures.
** [[Polibo|Poliwag]] and [[Togebo|Togepi]] also share this record, but in Pokémon Adventures only.
* Prior to Generation VI, Caterpie's body style was [[File:Body02.png]].
* In ''[[EP003|Ash Catches a Pokémon]]'', when Caterpie evolves into Metapod, the process was similar to a real caterpillar going into pupation. [[AG142|Later]] [[BW130|episodes]] show Caterpie evolving like the rest of the Pokémon do.
* Caterpie is tied with {{p|Weedle}} for having the lowest Special Defense stat of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon and is tied with five other Pokémon for having the lowest Special Defense stat of all Pokémon.

===Origin===
Caterpie is a stylized {{wp|caterpillar}}, most resembling an {{wp|Papilio xuthus|Asian swallowtail}}. Its "antenna" is an {{wp|osmeterium}}, an organ unique to swallowtail caterpillars which, like Caterpie, they use to emit a foul odor. The tip of Caterpie's tail resembles the horn at the rear end of most species of {{wp|Sphingidae|hawk moth}} larvae.

====Name origin====
Caterpie is a corruption of ''{{wp|caterpillar}}''.
